            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT is recorded in Hiſtory, that after the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Flood, the Iſles of the Gentiles were divided by the Poſterity of <hi>Japhet</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah;</hi> and it is probable, that this Iſland, among the reſt, was then peopled by his Progeny; the Hiſtory of whom may be eaſier wiſht for than recovered: And therefore it may ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to relate what ſome Antient Authors have recorded with much uncertainty of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors of
<hi>Japhet,</hi> whom they have named <hi>Samo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, Magus Sarron, Druis</hi> and <hi>Bardus:</hi> But rather to follow the Authority of <hi>Geoffery,</hi> Arch-Deacon of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> in his Hiſtory written in the Brittiſh Tongue, and tranſlated into Engliſh about five hundred years ſince, and begins his Chronology with <hi>Brute,</hi> who after the Poſterity of

<hi>Brute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall now give a brief Account of what is commonly received concerning <hi>Brute,</hi> and the Race of the Kings of <hi>Brittain</hi> that proceeded from him, though, with my Author, I ſhall not impoſe upon the belief of any in theſe Narrations. <hi>Brute</hi> the Son of
<hi>Sylvius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> the Son of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> after the Ruine of
<hi>Troy,</hi> and the Death of his Father, being baniſht into <hi>Greece,</hi> he there by his Valour reſcued and delivered the remainder of the Trojans his Countreymen, from the Captivity which they had been for many years ſufferers under the Grecians, with whom he departed to ſeek ſome new habitation, and aſſociating to himſelf <hi>Corineus,</hi> whom with another Band of exiled Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans he found in the way, after a long and tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Journey, and many notable encounters and atchievements, he arrived in this Iſland then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Albion,</hi> and landed at <hi>Totnes</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> in the year from the Creation of the World 2855. which was about the time that <hi>Jeptah</hi> and <hi>Samſon</hi> Judged <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and before the Birth of Chriſt 1116 years; and being made King or Governour of the Land, he called it by his own name <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> according to the opinion of many antient Authors; He alſo built the City of <hi>London</hi> which he named <hi>Troynovant</hi> or New <hi>Troy;</hi> At his Death
<hi>Brute</hi> divided the Country among his three Sons, unto <hi>Locrine</hi> his Eldeſt he gave the middle part between <hi>Humber</hi> and <hi>Severn,</hi> which from him was called
<hi>Loegria;</hi> To <hi>Camber</hi> his ſecond he bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40348:5"/>all the Region beyond the River <hi>Severn,</hi> which from him was called
<hi>Cambria,</hi> now <hi>Wales;</hi> To <hi>Allanact</hi> the youngeſt he left all the Land beyond <hi>Humber</hi> Northward, which was after called <hi>Albania,</hi> now <hi>Scotland;</hi> After which partition he deceaſed, having reigned 24 years, and was Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried at <hi>London. Locrinus</hi> ſucceeded his Father, and <hi>Humber</hi> King of the Hums or Scythians Invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Brother <hi>Albanacts</hi> Countrey, he and his Brother <hi>Camber</hi> aſſiſted
<hi>Albanact</hi> ſo ſucceſsfully, that they utterly defeated his Army, himſelf, and abundance of his Souldiers being Drowned in the River, from thence called <hi>Humber; Madan</hi> his Son reigned in his ſtead, then <hi>Mempricus, Ebrauh, Brute Greenſheeld, Leil</hi> who is ſaid to have built <hi>Carleil; Bladud</hi> a great Necromancer who is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to have made thoſe hot Baths at <hi>Bath,</hi> and to magnifie his skill, undertook to fly in the Air, but his Art failing, he fall upon the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> and broke his Neck.
<hi>Lear</hi> his Son was King after him, who was very unfortunate in two unnatural Daughters, whoſe Husbands ſtrove to deprive him of his Kingdom, but their deſigns being defeated, his youngeſt Daughter whom he had ſlighted was admitted Queen after him, to whom ſucceeded her two Nephews, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and <hi>Cunegad,</hi> between whom differences ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<hi>Morgan</hi> was ſlain and <hi>Cunegad</hi> reigned ſingly 30 years; Many other Kings of
<hi>Brittain</hi> are reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up after him, as <hi>Dunwallo</hi> D. of <hi>Cornwal, Belinus</hi> and <hi>Breanus</hi> who are ſaid to have Conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>France, Italy, Germany,</hi> and at laſt to have taken the City of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf. King <hi>Lud</hi> who much beautified
<hi>Troynovant,</hi> fortifying it with Walls and Gates, particularly <hi>Ludgate</hi> called after his name, and founded a Temple where it is thought St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s now ſtands, and changed the name of the City from <hi>Troynovant</hi> to <hi>Luds Town,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40348:5"/>now <hi>London;</hi> He left two Sons <hi>Androgeus</hi> and
<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantius</hi> under Age, whereupen <hi>Caſſibilane</hi> their Uncle was admitted Governour, in whoſe Reign <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> firſt Invaded this Iſland in the year from the Worlds Creation 3913. and 54 years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Birth of Chriſt, the Land being then not under one ſole Monarch or King, but divided into 28 petty Kingdoms or Provinces; <hi>Caeſar</hi> being landed at <hi>Deal</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> the news thereof was ſo welcome to the Senate of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that they Decreed a Thankſgiving ſhould be kept for 20 days toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<hi>Caſſibilane</hi> was only King of the <hi>Trinobantes</hi> who inhabited <hi>Middleſex, Eſſex</hi> and <hi>Hartfordſhire,</hi> but in this common danger the other Princes mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually agreed that he ſhould command in Chief to withſtand the Roman Invaſion, which he did with very great courage, beating them twice off from the Brittiſh ſhoar; his chief City was
<hi>Verulane</hi> near St. <hi>Albans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theomantius</hi> the Son of <hi>Lud</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Caſſibilane,</hi> who paid the three thouſand pound a year Tribute to the Romans which his Uncle had agreed to, when notwithſtanding the utmoſt Efforts for their Liberty, the <hi>Brittains</hi> were obliged to ſubmit to the Conquering <hi>Romans;</hi> Yet did not <hi>Caeſar</hi> wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
<hi>Brittain,</hi> for he never came towards the North, (which ſeveral of his Succeſſors afterwards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to bring under) but ſubjected only thoſe parts of the Iſland lying next to <hi>France,</hi> which our Countreyman <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> relates, that <hi>Caeſar</hi> diſcovered by ſetting up Proſpective Glaſſes on the Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> from whence he ſaw all the Havens and Creeks in <hi>England;</hi> So that he may rather ſeem to have diſcovered than reduced to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Power. <hi>Kymbeline</hi> or <hi>Cunobeline</hi> the Son of
<hi>Theomantius</hi> reigned next, whoſe principal ſeat was at <hi>Carnolodunum</hi> now
<hi>Malden</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> He is ſaid to have refuſed to pay the former Tribute,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40348:6"/>upon which <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> who fucceeded <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> deſigned thrice to make an Expedition hither to recover his Right, but was as oft diverted by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections in divers parts of his mighty Empire. <hi>Guiderus</hi> was King after his Father, and being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry valiant, refuſed Tribute to <hi>Caligula</hi> the Roman Emperor, who therefore reſolved, as his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and <hi>Tiberius</hi> had done, to reduce
<hi>Brittain,</hi> as being the utmoſt bounds of the Roman Monarchy, making great proviſion for this Noble Enterprize, being incouraged therein by <hi>Adminius</hi> the Son of
<hi>Cunoboline,</hi> who being baniſht by his Father, fled with ſome few followers to
<hi>Caligula</hi> for protection; <hi>Guiderus</hi> expected, and provided for his Arrival, who bringing down his Forces into <hi>Flanders,</hi> put them in Battel Array upon the Sea ſhore, planting his Engines of War, as if ready for an Engagement; after which the Emperor him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a Galley lanched into the Sea about two Bow-ſhots from the Land, and then preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and getting into a Pulpit provided for him, he by found of Trumpet cauſed his Souldiers to prepare for Battel, and then charged every Man to fill his Helmet with Cockle and Muſcle Shells, which he called, <hi>The Spoils of the Conquered Ocean,</hi> and gave as great Rewards to them for theſe trifles, as if they had performed ſome notable Service in War; and againſt the place he built a Tower as a Trophey of his Victory, the Ruines whereof (ſaith my Author) remain to this day, and is called, The <hi>Brittains Houſe.</hi> He carried many of theſe Shells to
<hi>Rome,</hi> boaſting of this honourable Voyage, and requiring a Triumph, which the Senate ſeeming unwilling to allow, he threatned to murther them all.</p>

               <hi>Claudius</hi> ſucceeded him in the Empire; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving leiſure, reſolved to make War upon the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,</hi> who had long neglected to pay their Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40348:6"/>being invited thereto by certain Brittiſh Fugitives, ordering <hi>Aulus Plautius</hi> a Roman Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, to tranſport the Veterane Souldiers out of <hi>France</hi> thither, to which they were very unwilling, complaining, <hi>That they muſt be forced to make War out of the World,</hi> for ſo they accounted this Iſland to be; but at length being Embarqued, they Landed unexpectedly upon the Brittains, who were incamped in the Iſle of <hi>Sheppey</hi> in
<hi>Kent,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating them, took the City of <hi>Camolodunum</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſubdued the Eaſt-part of the Iſland. <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> writes, That
<hi>Claudius</hi> Landed at <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> near <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> which he Beſieged, and <hi>Guiderus</hi> coming to relieve it, fought and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed againſt the Romans, till one
<hi>Hanno,</hi> Armed like a <hi>Brittain,</hi> preſſing through the midſt of the Troops till he came where <hi>Guiderus</hi> was, he inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſlew him, which <hi>Arviragus</hi> the King's Brother perceiving, to prevent the <hi>Brittains</hi> from being diſcouraged, putting on the Royal Robes, fought ſo couragiouſly, that the <hi>Romans</hi> were routed,
<hi>Claudius</hi> flying to his Ships, and <hi>Hanno</hi> to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning Forreſt, whom
<hi>Arviragus</hi> purſued and kill'd ere he could get to the Haven, from whence it is ſaid to have the name of <hi>Hanno</hi>'s Haven, then <hi>Hampton,</hi> now <hi>Southampton:</hi> After his Death the Land was many years under <hi>Roman</hi> Governours and Lieutenants, but the Silures or Inhabitants of <hi>South-Wales</hi> would not endure the Romiſh Yoke, relying much upon the Courage of their Prince <hi>Corvactacus,</hi> who incamping his Army on the top of an Hill, and ſtopping all the paſſages thereto with heaps of Stones, he expected the approach of his Enemies, ſtriving in the mean time to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate his Souldiers with incouraging Speeches, telling them, <hi>That day and that Battel would either reſtore them to their former Liberties, or elſe reduce them to perpetual ſlavery, and that they ſhould remember
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:40348:7"/>the valour of their Anceſtors, who formerly had driven</hi> Caeſar <hi>the Dictator out of their Countrey, and thereby delivered themſelves from</hi> Roman Taxes and Axes, and freed their <hi>Wives and Daughters from being debauched by their implacable Adverſaries;</hi> The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were much incouraged and eccho'd out their hopes of Victory, with ſo great a ſhout as much diſturbed the Romans, who thought the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations the
<hi>Brittains</hi> had raiſed to be impregnable, but <hi>Oſtorius</hi> marching forward, though oppoſed by a ſhower of Arrows, he at length broke down that rude ill compacted Fence, and coming to handy ſtrokes with the <hi>Brittains</hi> who had more courage than Armor, having neither Head-peice nor Coat of Mail, they were ſo fore galled with the Javelins and two-handed Swords of the Romans, that they ſoon fled; This Victory was unexpected by the Romans, and more conſiderable by the taking the Wife, Daughter and Brethren of <hi>Cataractus</hi> Priſoners, he himſelf flying to the Brigantes, or thoſe that Inhabited <hi>Lancaſhire, Cheſhire,</hi> &amp;c. for ſuccour, but was by <hi>Cartiſmunda</hi> the Queen trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly delivered into the hands of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, after nine years generous reſiſtance, and his fame having reached even to <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractus</hi> was carried thither and led in Triumph through the Roman Legions with his Brethren, Wife and Daughter, whoſe great Courage and ſtrange Attire filled the People with admiration and delight; His Body was almoſt naked, Paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with Figures of divers Beaſts, he wore a Chain of Iron about his Neck, and another about his middle, his Hair hanging down in Curls cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Back and Shoulders, and the Hair of his up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Lip or Whiskers parting in the middle reacht down to his Breaſt, he neither hung down his head as daunted with fear, nor asked mercy as the reſt, but with an undaunted Countenance coming
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40348:7"/>before the Imperial Seat, he made the following Speech to the Emperor on the Throne.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Great <hi>Caeſar,</hi> If my moderation in proſperity had been anſwerable to the greatneſs of my Birth and Eſtate, or the ſucceſs of my late attempts agreeable to the reſolution of my mind, I might have come to this City rather as a Friend to have been entertained, than as a Captive to be gazed upon; Neither would you have diſdained to have accepted the terms of Peace that I ſhould have offered, being a man of royal deſcent, and a Commander of many Warlike Nations; But though the Clouds have darkened my preſent Fortune, yet have the Heavens and Nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed that upon me in Birth and Mind, which none can vanquiſh or deprive me of; I plainly perceive that you make other mens miſeries the ſubject and matter of your Triumphs, and in this my Calamity, as in a Mirror, you now contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate your own Glory; Yet remember that I was a Prince furniſht with ſtrength of men, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliments of War, and that it is no ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I am now deprived of them all, ſince daily experience ſhews that the events of War are uncertain, and the ſucceſs of the beſt Policies are guided by uncertain Fates; And thus it was with me, who preſumed that the deep Ocean like a Wall incloſing our Land, which is ſo ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated by Divine Providence as if it were a World by it ſelf, might have been a ſufficient ſecurity and defence to us againſt any Foreign Invaſion; but I now obſerve that the deſire of Dominion admits of no Limitation, neither hath the Roman Ambition any bounds, for being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to Command all, it ſeems all muſt obey them; For my own part while I was able I made reſiſtance, being unwilling to ſubmit my Neck to a ſervile Yoak, ſince the Law of Nature allows
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:40348:8"/>every man to defend himſelf being aſſaulted, and to withſtand force by force; Had I yielded at firſt, neither your Glory nor my Ruine would have been ſo remarkable; Fortune hath now done her worſt, we have nothing left us but our lives, which if you take from us, our miſeries will have an end, and if you ſpare us, we ſhall live the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of your Clemency.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caeſar</hi> admiring at the Courage and Reſolution of ſo free a mind in a Captive condition, he par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him and the reſt, who being unchained from the Triumphal Fetters, they then did reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Agrippina</hi> the Empreſs, who ſate aloft on a Throne Royal; And afterwards continued at <hi>Rome</hi> to their Deaths for any thing we read to the contrary.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Oſtorius</hi> was recalled, <hi>Paulus Suetonius</hi> was ſent hither by the bloody <hi>Nero,</hi> during whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the Brittains made ſeveral attempts to regain their Countrey, and free themſelves from the inſupportable ſlavery and miſery wherein they lived; for <hi>Arvivagus</hi> having made <hi>Nero</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and his two Daughters his Heirs, hoping thereby to ſecure the Kingdom to his Family it happened otherwiſe; For the Land was ruined by the Roman Souldiers, <hi>Voadicia</hi> his Queen beaten and abuſed, her Daughters Raviſhed, the Nobles deprived of their Eſtates, and the People in a moſt deplorable ſervitude; <hi>Voadicia</hi> made ſuch ſenſible Remonſtrances of theſe unſufferable wrongs to the People, that ſhe raiſed an Army of an hundred thouſand men, who willingly ſubmitted to her Conduct, and with whom, being confident in her numbers, ſhe ingaged againſt the Romans at ſome diſadvantage, and was vanquiſhed by them with the loſs of fourſcore thouſand Brittains; And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had ſhewed all the courage of a gallant Commander, and had made ſo notable an attempt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:40348:8"/>for redeeming her Countrey from bondage, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to fall one time or other into her Enemies hands, ſhe like another <hi>Lucretia</hi> fell upon her own Sword and Died. In the 73 year from our Saviours Birth.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If the Reader deſire to know more of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings of <hi>Brittain,</hi> the Invaſion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and the Life of this renowned Queen <hi>Voa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicia,</hi> I have publiſhed a Book called Female Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency or the Ladies Glory, wherein there is a full account of all theſe particulars, being of the ſame value with this.</q>
            </p>
            <p>About this time Hiſtorians report that Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was firſt planted in this Iſland, certain Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples being ſent by <hi>Philip</hi> the Apoſtle out of <hi>France</hi> into
<hi>Brittain,</hi> whereof <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> that Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Body of Chriſt was chief, who firſt laid the Foundation of the true Faith at a place called
<hi>Avalon,</hi> now <hi>Glaſtenbury</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> where with his twelve Aſſiſtants he Preached the Goſpel of Salvation to the Iſlanders, and left there Bodies Buried in that place.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galgacus</hi> a valiant Commander of the <hi>Caledonians</hi> was the laſt Prince that reſiſted the Roman Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and was made General of the <hi>Brittains</hi> againſt the Invaſions of <hi>Agricola</hi> in the Reign of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Domitian,</hi> he with the chief of the Brittiſh Nobility made a very valiant defence for ſeveral years, but the Romans ſeeming to be decreed by Heaven to reduce the World under their obedience vanquiſhed all that oppoſed them, and in a bloody Battel defeated him and his Forces, and laid all in ruins before them, whereby the whole Iſland was ſubjected to the Roman Emperors, 136 years after the entrance of <hi>Julius Caeſar. Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> the Welſh Hiſtorian doth here bring in a ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Brittiſh Kings, and amongſt them <hi>Marius</hi> who Conquered <hi>Roderic</hi> King of the Picts and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40348:9"/>Scots, whoſe Monument crected near <hi>Carleile,</hi> wherein his Victory was inſcribed, remained a long time; After him <hi>Corlus</hi> his Son is ſaid to ſucceed, who being carried to <hi>Rome</hi> and Educated there in his Youth, upon his return to his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, he gratefully paid the Romans their Tribute without conſtraint, but we muſt leave theſe rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as doubtful as we find them.</p>
            <p>The Picts and Northern Inhabitants of <hi>Brittain</hi> continuing to Invade and Deſtroy the
<hi>Brittains</hi> who were now become Tributary to the Romans, the Emperor <hi>Adrian</hi> in 124. came hither in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for their relief, and drove the Picts out of the plain Countrey into the Woods and Mountains where the Roman Horſemen could not attack them, but finding the Air too ſevere for his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and the Countrey barren, inſtead of leaving the Brittains a Roman Garriſon, he built a ſtrong Wall or Fortification of Earth for their defence againſt their Enemies; It was compoſed of Stakes driven deep into the Ground, and bound toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther like a hedge, which being filled up with Turf and Earth, became a ſtrong Rampant againſt ſudden Incurſions. It began at the River <hi>Eden</hi> in <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> near <hi>Carleile;</hi> and ended at the River <hi>Tyne</hi> near <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> being eighty miles in length. After which the Brittains continued for many years in peace without oppoſition, time and caſtom cauſing them to bear the Yoak of ſubjection patiently, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering they were obliged to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans for aſſiſtance againſt their own Barbarous Countreymen.</p>
            <p>After the Romans had Conquered the greateſt part of the World, the ſucceeding Emperors poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickly permitted Kingdoms and Provinces to be governed by Kings and Governours of their own Nation, thereby the better to keep them in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Empire; Among others <hi>Antoninus
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40348:9"/>Pius</hi> conſtituted <hi>Lucius</hi> to be King of <hi>Brittain,</hi> who diſliking the Idolatry and Paganiſm of his People, and being much affected with the holy lives of the Chriſtians, and with the Miracles wrought among them, and incouraged by the Emperors Edicts in their favour, he allowed the publick Profeſſion thereof, being the firſt Chriſtian King in the World, and <hi>Brittain</hi> the firſt Kingdom that imbraced the Goſpel by publick Authority; After this he ſent two Perſons to <hi>Eleutherius</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Rome,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the form of ſome Laws to Govern his People by; To which the Biſhop replied,
<q>You deſire us to ſend you the Roman and Imperial Laws, for the Reformation of the People, and Guidance of the King and Kingdom of <hi>Brittain;</hi> The Roman Laws we altogether miſlike, but the Law of God by no means; By the Divine Clemency you have of late received the Law and Faith of Chriſt into your Kingdom; You have with you the Old and New Teſtament, out of them (in Gods name) by the advice of your Counſellors, take you a Law, and therewith by Gods permiſſion Govern your Kingdom, for you are Gods Vicar there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> By this we may ſee the vaſt difference between the humility and piety of the Roman Church in the Primitive times, and the Pride, Cruelty and Uſurpation of the preſent Synagogue of Satan.</p>
            <p>This Epiſtle with two Preachers, <hi>Fagianus</hi> and <hi>Daniranus</hi> whom the Biſhop ſent to King <hi>Lucius,</hi> prevailed ſo much upon him, that being Baptized into the Chriſtian Faith, he converted the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh Temples of the Arch-<hi>Flamins</hi> and
<hi>Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines</hi> into ſo many Biſhops Sees, whereof <hi>London, York,</hi> and St.
<hi>David</hi>'s in <hi>Wales</hi> were made the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans; A Table that remains in St.
<hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in <hi>Cornhill London</hi> Records, that King <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> founded that Church for a Cathedral, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40348:10"/>likewiſe St. <hi>Peter's Weſtminſter,</hi> now the Abbey, and likewiſe
<hi>Dover</hi> Caſtle; He reigned 12 years and lies buried at <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and dying without Children left the Roman Emperors his Heirs, of whom <hi>Commodus</hi> ſucceeded, in whoſe Reign the Roman Legions in <hi>Brittain</hi> fell into divers muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, becauſe the Emperor inſtead of Senators and Conſuls, who uſed to Command them, put infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Perſons over them, but <hi>Helvius Pertinax</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent hither quieted all diſſentions with the ſevere puniſhment of the Offenders, and at length by his policy he obtained the Imperial Dignity; <hi>Severus</hi> Reigned after him, whom <hi>Albinus</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of <hi>Brittain</hi> oppoſed, and aſſiſted by the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Youth, fought a Battel with him in
<hi>France,</hi> where <hi>Albinus</hi> was defeated, and <hi>Severus</hi> confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Empire, and then coming over into <hi>Brittain,</hi> endeavoured to ſecure the Countrey to himſelf by erecting ſeveral Walls and Forts in the In-land Parts, and repairing thoſe with Stone which were formerly of Turf or Earth, and finding the Northern Brittains or Scots very troubleſome, he built a Wall or Fortification for defending the more Civilized from the Savage and Barbarous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; this Wall croſſed the whole Iſland from Sea to Sea, beginning at the Frith of <hi>Solney</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> and ending at <hi>Timnouth,</hi> in length 132 Miles, it was built with Turfs and Timber with ſtrong Bulwarks at a convenient diſtance, near, if not upon the Foundation of the former, called <hi>Adrians</hi> Wall, the ruins whereof are yet viſible through the Counties of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland,</hi> for which act he Sirnamed himſelf <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicus,</hi> and after 18 years Reign died at <hi>York</hi> in
212. not ſo much of Sickneſs, ſay ſome Authors, as of Diſcontent and Grief; Others ſay of a Mortal wound given him by <hi>Fulgence</hi> Captain of the Picts; <hi>Baſſianus Garacalla</hi> his Son ſucceeded him, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40348:10"/>haſtning to <hi>Rome</hi> offered very eaſie conditions of Peace to the yet reſiſting Brittains, who being tyred with the long Wars accepted thereof, and Hoſtages were given for conſerving the ſame. And now the Royal Title of Kings of <hi>Brittain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annexed to the Roman Emperors, they by their continual diviſions for gaining the Imperial Dignity, gave a long breathing time of Peace to this haraſſed Iſland, ſo that little of action happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here till the reigns of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximin,</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Carauſius</hi> being by the Romans made Admiral of the Brittiſh Seas to guard them againſt the Pyracies of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Belgians,</hi> he by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at their Robberies became rich and popular, ſo that having notice the Emperor had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be ſecretly kill'd, he by the aid of the Picts and Northern Brittains took upon him the Title of Emperor of <hi>Rome,</hi> and valiantly defended his Dignity for ſeven years; At length
<hi>Maximin</hi> Marched to the Brittiſh Ocean with a powerful Army, but hearing of the ſtrength of <hi>Carauſius</hi> and wanting Seamen, he Encamped on the French Shoar, and concluding a Peace with him, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to <hi>Rome; Carauſius</hi> Governed the Brittains with Juſtice and Peace for ſeven years, repairing the Roman Wall, and defending them from their brutiſh Enemies, but was at length Murdered by his treacherous friend <hi>Alectus,</hi> who took upon him the Imperial Purple.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> after the Death of <hi>Carauſius</hi> reſolved to attempt the recovery of this Iſland, and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius</hi> with a Potent Army Landed here in a great Fog, without obſervation or hindrance, at which <hi>Alectus</hi> being ſurprized was ſlain with moſt of his Army, the reſt eſcaping toward <hi>London</hi> deſigned to Plunder and Burn it, but the Romans made ſuch ſpeed that they prevented them, killing <hi>Gallus</hi> their Leader, and throwing his Body into a Brook
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40348:11"/>that ran through the City, which was after called <hi>Gallus</hi> his Brook, now <hi>Walbrook.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, theſe two Tyrants <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximin</hi> raiſed a diſmal Perſecution in all the parts of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, whereby 17000 Chriſtians, Men and Women were Crowned with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom, within the ſpace of one Month, and in <hi>Brittain</hi> the Churches were demoliſhed, their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and other Writings burnt, and for 10 years together the poor People were continually tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented without intermiſſion, or any place being free from the Blood of Martyrs, who were conſtant in the profeſſion of the Faith; Among others St.
<hi>Alban</hi> was beheaded at the Town bearing his name, whom <hi>Fortunatus Priſcus</hi> mentions.</p>

<hi>Coverleon</hi> in <hi>Monmouthſhire,</hi> and ſo many at <hi>Lichfield</hi> that the place became a <hi>Golgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> or Field of Dead Corps, and therefore the Seal of Arms of that City is charged with many Martyrs to this day; But theſe two bloody Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors enjoyed their honours a very ſhort time, for within a year after this bloody Perſecution, they were both of them by the hand of God (ſaith <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi>) ſtruck with ſuch a mad humour, that they renounced the Empire, and laying aſide the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Robes, <hi>Diocleſian</hi> retired into

<hi>Brittains,</hi> in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Iſlands of <hi>Scotland;</hi> He then made War with
<hi>Maxentius</hi> a wicked Uſurper, Necromancer and Tyrant, and being ſenſible that ſucceſs depends much upon the bleſſing of Heaven, yet doubting what God to Invocate to his aſſiſtance (as not yet fully ſetled in the Chriſtian Faith) he devoutly caſt up his Eyes to the Eaſt, and (ſaith <hi>Euſebius</hi>) thereupon the Sign of the Croſs, or the firſt Greek Characters of the Name of Chriſt were viſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to his ſight, the Stars like Letters being ſo placed that this Sentence might be read in Greek, <hi>In hoc Vince, In this ſhalt thou overcome,</hi> which Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Victory gave him ſuch incouragement, that ingaging the Tyrant <hi>Maxentius,</hi> he utterly defeated his Forces, himſelf being drown'd, by the fall of a Bridge, into the River <hi>Tyber;</hi> After this <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> obtained ſeveral other Victories, and then to compleat his worthy actions, he laid the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtians ſecurity, by bringing them under the protection of Kings and Princes, which could never ſince be ſhaken, though often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by ſeveral Heathen Emperors his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors; At his Death he divided his large Empire among his three Sons,
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Eldeſt hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>France, Spain,</hi> part of <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Brittain</hi> for
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:40348:12"/>his Lot; After him ſeveral other Emperors ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded without making any great alteration in the <hi>Brittiſh</hi> affairs, neither were there any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tranſactions; The laſt of them was <hi>Theodoſius</hi> in the year of Chriſt 423. about which time the <hi>Goths</hi> who had faithfully ſerved the <hi>Romans</hi> about 20 years, being diſobliged and ſlighted, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge their wrongs, they choſe for their Leader a valiant
<hi>Goth</hi> called <hi>Alaricus,</hi> who proved the ſcourge of <hi>Rome;</hi> for the
<hi>Vandals, Alans,</hi> and <hi>Suecians</hi> joyning with him, they began a fierce War in
<hi>Auſtria</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> increaſing their forces into ſuch vaſt Multitudes, that the World ſtood amazed, and trembled at them. For ſoon after two hundred thouſand
<hi>Goths</hi> more reſorted to them, who with theſe united Forces over-run <hi>Thracia, Hungary, Auſtria, Sclavonia</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> ruining and deſtroying all things in ſo dreadful a manner that it ſeemed rather the Ravage of Devils than Men. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire thus declining, they drew their Forces out of <hi>Brittain:</hi> But a while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the
<hi>Brittains</hi> were extreamly diſtreſſed by the continual diſturbers of their Peace, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts;</hi> therefore they ſent their Ambaſſadors to
<hi>Rome,</hi> with their Garments rent, and Duſt upon their Heads, bewailing their moſt miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and begging Aſſiſtance; whereupon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour ſent a Regiment of Soldiers into <hi>Brittain,</hi> under <hi>Gallio,</hi> who for a while defended them, but was ſoon called back with his Legion into <hi>France,</hi> to ſecure the Country about
<hi>Paris.</hi> At his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he adviſed the <hi>Brittains</hi> to ſtand upon their Guard; and for the future to provide for their own ſafety, and not to depend upon any ſuccours from the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had their hands full of troubles nearer home.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Romans,</hi> after they had commanded in <hi>Brittain</hi> above five hundred years, took their laſt
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40348:13"/>farewel thereof. During their continuance here, they have levied ſo many Companies of ſtout <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> for their Wars in <hi>Armenia, Egypt,</hi> and other Frontier Countries, that they had much diſpeopled the Nation. Some of theſe <hi>Britiſh</hi> Souldiers, after they were worn out in the Wars, had <hi>Armorica</hi> in <hi>France</hi> aſſigned them by <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> for their good Service in the Wars, from whom it was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Little Brittain.</hi> Unto this Country, in the time of <hi>Gratian</hi> the Emperour, was <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſula</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Dinoth</hi> Regent of <hi>Cornwal</hi> ſent with eleven thouſand Virgins, who were to have been married to their Countreymen the
<hi>Brittains;</hi> but they all periſhed e're they arrived; ſome being drowned in the Sea by Tempeſt, and the Remainder put to the Sword by the barbarous <hi>Huns</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would not yield to their filthy Luſts.</p>
            <p>The Southern or more Citiliz'd <hi>Brittains</hi> being extreamly weakned by the <hi>Romans</hi> exporting ſo many of their valiant Soldiers, and then forſaking them, and likewiſe by Scarcity and Famine; their inveterate Foes, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> take this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Opportunity to infeſt them with all manner of Cruelties and Barbarities: So that being no longer able to defend and ſecure themſelves, they ſupplicate for Aid from
<hi>Germany,</hi> inviting the <hi>Jutes, Angles,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> who then inhabited
<hi>Jutland, Holſtein,</hi> and the Coaſts along the River <hi>Rhene,</hi> to come to their Aſſiſtance. Their propoſal was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily embraced, and nine thouſand of them, under the command of two Brethren, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and <hi>Horſa,</hi> entred the Land at
<hi>Ebsfleet</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Thanet</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> where they were received with great Joy, and entertained with Songs, according to the cuſtom of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> who alloted them that Iſland to inhabit, and a while after <hi>Vortigern</hi> then King of the
<hi>Brittains,</hi> allowed <hi>Hengiſt</hi> ſo much Land as he could encompaſs within a Bull-hide cut out
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40348:13"/>into Thongs, wherein he built a Caſtle, which from thence had the Name of
<hi>Thong-Caſtle;</hi> when it was finiſhed, <hi>Hengiſt</hi> invited the King to ſee it, who there fell in love with <hi>Rowena,</hi> the Daughter or Neice of <hi>Hengiſt;</hi> upon which Match <hi>Hengiſt</hi> grew more bold, contriving to make the Iſland his Inheritance; and thereupon ſent for freſh For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who at their arrival cauſed ſeveral Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Natives, diſpoſſeſſing the people of their eſtates, every Commander reckoning that part of the Country his own where they could over-match the <hi>Brittains,</hi> where they commanded as abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Princes; whereby the Country was burdened with ſeven Kings at once, each of them having So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Command within his own limits, though ſtill one ſeemed to be Supreme over all the reſt.</p>
            <p>This was uſually called the <hi>Saxons Heptarchy,</hi> or ſeven Kingdoms; The firſt and chiefeſt, was that of <hi>Kent</hi> only governed by <hi>Hengiſt</hi> and his Succeſſors for three hundred ſeventy two years. The next was the Kingdom of the <hi>South Saxons,</hi> containing the Counties of <hi>Suſſex</hi> or <hi>Surrey,</hi> continuing a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirteen years. 3. That of the <hi>Weſt Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> comprehending the Counties of <hi>Cornwal, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von, Dorſet, Somerſet, Wilts, Berks,</hi> and <hi>Hampſhire;</hi> it laſted three hundred years. 4. The <hi>Eaſt Saxons</hi> Kingdom, which was <hi>Eſſex, Middleſex,</hi> and part of <hi>Hartfordſhire.</hi> 5. The Kingdom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> containing the Counties of <hi>Northumberland, Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morland, Cumberland, Durham, York</hi> and
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> continuing three hundred ſeventy nine years. 6. The Kingdom of
<hi>Mercia,</hi> which was compos'd of the Counties of <hi>Oxford, Gloceſter, Worceſter, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop, Cheſhire, Stafford, Warwick, Buckingham, Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Huntington,</hi> part of
<hi>Hartfordſhire, Northampton, Rutland, Lincoln, Leiceſter, Derby,</hi> and
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> continuing two hundred and two years. 7. The laſt Kingdom was that of the
<hi>Eaſt-Angles,</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:40348:14"/>the Counties of <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> which laſted three hundred and fifty three years.</p>
            <p>Yet during the time of this <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> many of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes valiantly defended their lawful Inheritances, and with great courage endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Yoke from being impoſed upon their Necks: Among whom was <hi>Vortimer,</hi> the Son of <hi>Vortigern</hi> aforementioned, for <hi>Vortigern</hi> after ſixteen years Reign depoſed from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for his kindneſs to the <hi>Saxons,</hi> his Son
<hi>Vortimer</hi> was choſen King of the <hi>Brittains,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently engaged againſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> gaining ſo much in four famous victories over them, that they were almoſt extirpated. He erected a Monument in the Iſle of <hi>Thenta,</hi> in the place where the
<hi>Saxons</hi> were overthrown, which <hi>to this day is called the Stowers,</hi> wherein he commanded his Body to be buried, that the <hi>Saxons</hi> might be terrified with the ſight thereof. He reſtored the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then much decayed, and rebuilt the Churches deſtroyed by the <hi>Pagan Saxons. Rowena</hi> procured his Death by Poyſon, after which his Father <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figern</hi> was re-eſtabliſhed in the Government: But being oppreſſed by the
<hi>Saxons,</hi> and purſued by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relius,</hi> he fled into <hi>Wales,</hi> where, in a Caſtle which he built by <hi>Merlin</hi>'s Directions, in the Mountains, he, with his Daughter, whom he had taken to Wife, were burnt to aſhes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aurelius Ambrotius</hi> was likewiſe very ſucceſsful againſt the <hi>Saxons.</hi> He is ſaid to have built <hi>Stone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henge</hi> near <hi>Salisbury,</hi> in remembrance of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of three hundred of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility, who were there ſlain by the Treachery of the <hi>Saxons. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ter Pendragon,</hi> who ſucceeded him, was no leſs fortunate. He was named <hi>Pendragon,</hi> either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe at his Birth there appeared a fiery Comet like a Dragons Head, or from his Royal Banner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was the Picture of a Dragon with a Golden Head.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:40348:14"/>He died of Poyſon put into a Well wherein he uſed to drink. <hi>Arthur</hi> his Son and Succeſſor won twelve Battels againſt the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and chaſed
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gern</hi> their Captain from his Camp in <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to <hi>York,</hi> from whence he eſcaped into <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> The Relicks of <hi>Arthur's</hi> Round Table are to this time ſhewn in <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> with the Twenty four Seats. After him reigned
<hi>Conſtantine, Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Conantus, Vortiporus, Malgo, Canonus,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticus.</hi> This laſt King raiſed a Civil War among his own Subjects the <hi>Britains,</hi> which made them forſake him, and leave him to the Mercy of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who purſuing him, he fled to
<hi>Cirenceſter</hi> in <hi>Berkshire</hi> for ſafety; but his Enemies taking ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sparrows, faſtned fire to their feet, and let them fly into the City, who lighting upon ſtraw, and thatcht houſes, burnt the City to the Ground; but <hi>Careticus</hi> eſcaped, and fled for ſecurity to the Mountains of <hi>Wales,</hi> where he died.</p>
            <p>After twenty four years Civil Diſſention <hi>Cadwan</hi> was made King. During theſe Troubles, <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk, who was ſent hither by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> to convert the
<hi>Britains</hi> carrying himſelf very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolently at a Meeting with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops, at a place thence named <hi>Auſtin's Oak</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> they could come to no Agreement; whereupon it is thought, <hi>Auſtin</hi> contrived this cruel Revenge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cadwallo</hi> was victorious over the <hi>Saxons,</hi> ſlaying <hi>Edwin</hi> King of
<hi>Northumberland,</hi> and his Son <hi>Osfride</hi> in a bloody Battel. He died in peace, ſay the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Writers, and was buried at St. <hi>Martin's</hi> Church in <hi>London;</hi> his Statue on Horſeback in Braſs being ſet upon <hi>Ludgate,</hi> for a terrour to the
<hi>Saxons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>CAdwalloder</hi> the Son of <hi>Cadwallo</hi> fought manfully againſt the <hi>Saxons;</hi> but the diſtractions among his Nobility much hindered his proceedings. There was likewiſe a dreadful Famine in his Reigh, ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:40348:15"/>that the common People reckoned Roots and Herbs to be dainty Food: This was followed by a woful Mortality, which was ſo raging and ſudden, that great numbers of People were ſurpriz'd by Death while they were eating, drinking, walking and ſpeaking. Theſe calamities laſted near eleven years, ſo that the Country was almoſt depopulated, the King and his <hi>Britiſh</hi> Peers being forced to leave the Land, who went to his Couſin
<hi>Alan,</hi> King of <hi>Little Britain</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Saxons</hi> taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of theſe ſevere miſeries, lamentably op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the wretched
<hi>Britains,</hi> to whoſe Aid <hi>Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader,</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of his Couſin
<hi>Alan,</hi> did once deſign to return, but being diverted by a Dream which he had, he went on Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> and according to the Superſtition of that Age, he there turned Monk, where he ſoon after died and was buried; with whom died all the hopes of the <hi>Britains,</hi> he being the laſt King of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Blood, whereby the <hi>Saxons</hi> became So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lords and Maſters of this Iſland. And thus was this unhappy Country a ſecond time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by Strangers, which hapned about the Year of our Lord 689.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britains</hi> being thus outed of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the Conquering <hi>Saxons,</hi> retired beyond the River <hi>Severn,</hi> and therein fortified themſelves, which Country thereupon came to be called <hi>Wales,</hi> and the People <hi>Walſh</hi> or <hi>Welchmen;</hi> not that the word <hi>Walſh</hi> ſignified in the Saxon Language a Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner or Alien (for how could they be called Aliens in their Native Countrey) but <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Waliſh</hi> from
<hi>Galles</hi> or <hi>Galliſh</hi> by changing <hi>G</hi> into W ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of the <hi>Saxons;</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> being deſcended of the <hi>Gaules</hi> kept their own name ſtill, though ſomewhat altered in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as is ſaid before; and to this day the French call the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> by the name of <hi>Le Prince
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40348:15"/>le Galles;</hi> At firſt their Chiefs were honoured with the Titles of Kings of <hi>Wales,</hi> and are theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. 1. <hi>Idwallo</hi> in the year of Chriſt 688. called <hi>Iror</hi> the Son of <hi>Alan.</hi> 2. <hi>Roderick.</hi> 3. <hi>Conan.</hi> 4.
<hi>Mervyn.</hi> 5. <hi>Roderick</hi> Sirnamed the Great, who left <hi>Wales</hi> between his three Sons, allotting unto each his part, the Country being divided into <hi>North-Wales, South-Wales</hi> and <hi>Powys-Land,</hi> which had their ſeveral Lords and Princes;
<hi>North-Wales</hi> fell to the ſhare of <hi>Amarawd</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick Mawr,</hi> or the Great, the laſt King thereof, with a ſuperiority of Power over both the reſt, who were but Homagers to this; It containeth the County of <hi>Merioneth,</hi> part of
<hi>Denbigh, Flint, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvan,</hi> and the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> which being the more Mountainous Parts, and of difficult acceſs, conſequently preſerved their Liberty longeſt, and do ſtill keep their Language from the Incurſions of the <hi>Engliſh; Aberfraw</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey</hi> was the Princes Palace, who were thence ſometimer called Kings of
<hi>Aberfraw.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>South-Wales</hi> in the diviſion of the Country fell to <hi>Cadel</hi> the ſecond Son, comprehending the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Glamorgan, Pembroke, Carmarthen, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> and part of

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Powys-land</hi> was beſtowed by <hi>Roderick</hi> upon his youngeſt Son <hi>Mervyn,</hi> containing the Counties of <hi>Montgomery</hi> and <hi>Radnor,</hi> with part of <hi>Denbigh, Brecknock, Merioneth</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire;</hi> His chief Palace was <hi>Matraval</hi> in
<hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40348:16"/>whence the Princes thereof were ſo called; This Countrey continued in the Line of <hi>Mervyn</hi> a long time together, but much afflicted and diſmembred by the Princes of
<hi>North-Wales</hi> who caſt a greedy eye upon it; The laſt that held it entire was
<hi>Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith,</hi> who left it to his two Sons <hi>Madoc</hi> and <hi>Griffith,</hi> of which
<hi>Madock</hi> died at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in 1160. and <hi>Griffith</hi> was by King

            </p>
            <p>In theſe ſeveral Diviſions were different Kings and Princes, who long ſtrugled with the
<hi>Saxons</hi> for their Liberties; But becauſe we find very little mention of their Actions in our Chronicles, I ſhall proceed with the Hiſtory of the <hi>Saxons</hi> and <hi>Danes,</hi> and afterward give an account of the actions of ſome of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Kings and Princes, till that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality was wholly ſubdued to the Crown of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Saxons,</hi> according to the common fate of Conquerours, after they had ſubdued their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, diſagreed among themſelves, and ſeveral of their Princes incroached upon the Territories of each other, and ſo became petty Monarchs of ſome part of <hi>Britain:</hi> Theſe were reckoned to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen in number, till at laſt <hi>Egbert,</hi> the eighteenth King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> got command over all the ſeven Kingdoms of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſo became ſole Monarch of
<hi>England,</hi> which none of his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors before ever obtained. He had War fourteen years with the <hi>Corniſh</hi> and <hi>Welch,</hi> and took <hi>Weſt-cheſter,</hi> their chief hold, from them, making a ſtrict Law againſt any <hi>Welcoman</hi> that ſhould paſs over <hi>Offa's Dike,</hi> or ſet one Foot within his <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Dominions. He ſlew
<hi>Bernulf</hi> King of <hi>Mercis</hi> in Battel, and drove the King of <hi>Kent</hi> out of his Kingdom. The <hi>Eaſt Angles</hi> and <hi>Eaſt Saxons</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40348:16"/>to him, and likewiſe the <hi>South Saxons;</hi> whereupon he cauſed himſelf to be crowned abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarch at <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> And this Monarchy continued in the <hi>Saxons,</hi> till the <hi>Danes</hi> firſt got, and then loſt it again; and the
<hi>Saxons</hi> Iſſue failing upon their next entrance, it then fell to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> as by the Sequel will appear. In the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth year of <hi>Egbert</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> with thirty three Ships landed in <hi>England,</hi> to whom he gave Battle, but had the worſt of the day, loſing two of his chief Captains, and two Biſhops; but the <hi>Danes</hi> returning two years after into <hi>Wales,</hi> and joyning with the <hi>Welch, Egbert</hi> overcame both
<hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Welch</hi> together.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> his Son ſucceeded; after whom reign'd <hi>Ethelbald, Ethelbert, Ethelred,</hi> and then <hi>Alfred,</hi> in whoſe time the <hi>Danes,</hi> under <hi>Roll</hi> a Nobleman, came over with a great Army, but by the Valour of <hi>Alfred</hi> were beaten. This virtuous Prince divided the twenty four hours of the Day and Night into three equal parts, which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the burning of a Taper ſet in his Chapel, Clocks and Watches being not then in uſe: Eight hours he ſpent in Contemplation, Reading, and Prayer, other eight, for his Repoſe, and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life; and the other eight in Affairs of State. He divided the Kingdom into Shires, Hundreds, and Tythings, for the better Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Juſtice, and ſuppreſſing of Robbers and Felons; which had ſo good effect, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might Travel with all manner of ſecurity: yea, ſaith my Author, if Bracelets of Gold had been hung in the High-ways, none durſt have preſumed to have taken them away. He commanded all his Subjects who poſſeſſed two Hides of Land, to bring up their Sons in Learning till they were at leaſt fifteen years old, aſſerting,
<q>That he accounted a man Free born, and yet Illiterate, to be no better
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40348:17"/>than a Beaſt, a Sot, and a Brainleſs Creature: </q> Neither would he admit any into Office that were not ſo. He tranſlated the Holy Goſpel into the <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, was devout in the Service of God, and a great Protector of Widows and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> his eldeſt Son ſucceeded him, againſt whom his Nephew <hi>Ethelwald</hi> rebelled. His Siſter <hi>Elfleda</hi> had very hard Travel of her firſt Child, whereupon ſhe ever after forbore the Nuptial Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, alledging it to be an over-fooliſh Pleaſure which occaſioned ſuch bitter Pains; and liſting her ſelf a Souldier under her Brother, ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed many valiant exploits againſt the <hi>Danes;</hi> againſt whom <hi>Edward</hi> obtained a great Victory near <hi>Wolverhampton,</hi> wherein two of their Kings were ſlain, with many of the Nobility and a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Common Souldiers, which procured him both Fear and Love from the People.</p>
            <p>After his death <hi>Ethelſtane</hi> reigned, who is ſaid to be the firſt Anointed King of this Iſland: He enlarged his Dominions farther than he received them. He overthrew
<hi>Godfrey</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland, Howell</hi> King of
<hi>Wales,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> forcing them to ſubmit to his pleaſure; after which he again reſtored them to their Dignities, glorying,
<q>That it was more Honour to make a King, than to be a King.</q> Theſe actions procured him much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown from his Neighbour Princes, who courted his Friendſhip, and ſent him curious Preſents. <hi>Othy</hi> the Emperor, who married his Siſter, ſent him a curioſity richly ſet with Precious Stones, very ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially contrived, wherein were Land-skips with Vines, Corn, and men ſeeming ſo naturally to move, as if they had been real. The King of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> ſent him a ſumptuous Ship, richly guilt, with Purple Sails. The King of <hi>France</hi> ſent him a Sword,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40348:17"/>which was ſaid to have been <hi>Conſtantine's the Great,</hi> the Hilt whereof was all of Gold, and therein, as they ſaid, was one of the Nails which faſtned Chriſt to the Croſs: He likewiſe ſent the Spear of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> reported to be the ſame where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with our Saviour's ſide was pierced; alſo a part of the Croſs, a piece of the Crown of Thorns, and the Banner of St. <hi>Maurice.</hi> It is related, That this King
<hi>Ethelſtane,</hi> or <hi>Athelſtane,</hi> in the third year of his Reign, was ſo haraſſed by the <hi>Danes,</hi> that he was forced to ſhut himſelf up in
<hi>Wincheſter</hi> City; who propounded to him, either to ſubmit, and hold the Realm of them, or to determine the Quarrel between two Champions of each ſide. The King was much perplexed at theſe Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe his three valiant Knights, <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of
<hi>Warwick,</hi> (who lived in his Reign, or not at all) one <hi>Herand</hi> another couragious Knight, and Earl <hi>Rohand Guy's</hi> Father-in-Law, were gone to the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> In this ſtrait, after he had prayed for Deliverance, it is ſaid, he had a Viſion, wherein he was directed to riſe early the next morning, and taking two Biſhops with him, to get up to the top of the North Gate of that City, where he ſhould ſee a likely Man, clothed as a Pilgrim, bare-foot, and on his bare Head a Chaplet of White Roſes, and that this ſhould be the man that ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer <hi>Colebrand</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Gaint (for ſo was his Name) and free the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. The next day the King thus attended at the Gate, ſees Earl <hi>Guy</hi> ſo habited, being newly arrived from <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> whereupon <hi>Athelſtane</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing himſelf to him, deſires him to accept the Combat, as being ordained by Heaven to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit this Realm from Tyranny. <hi>Guy</hi> replied,
<q>My Lord, you may eaſily perceive that I am not in a Condition to take upon me this Fight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing haraſſed and weakened by daily Travel;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:40348:18"/>lay this task therefore upon your ſtout and hardy Soldiers, whom you were wont very much to eſteem. Ah, ſaid the King, ſuch indeed I had, but they are gone; ſome to the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> as one valiant Knight, called <hi>Guy,</hi> who was Earl of
<hi>Warwick:</hi> I had alſo a couragious Servant, named Sir <hi>Herand de Ardene;</hi> Would to God they were now here, for then would this Duel be ſoon undertaken, and the War quickly finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> In ſpeaking which Words the Tears trick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down his Cheeks, which made ſuch impreſſion upon the Pilgrim, that he engaged to undertake the Combate. Upon the day appointed,
<hi>Guy</hi> put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the King's beſt Armour, the Sword of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine the Great,</hi> St. <hi>Maurice</hi> his Lance, and one of the King's beſt Courſers, he rode through
<hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> appearing like a moſt accompliſh'd Knight, and went to the place appointed, which was in a Valley called <hi>Chiltecumb,</hi> where <hi>Colebrand</hi> ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter came, ſo loaded with Armour, that his Horſe could ſcarce bear him, and a Cart driven before him, filled with <hi>Daniſh</hi> Axes, great Clubs with knobs of Iron, ſquared Bars of Steel, and Iron Hooks to pluck his Adverſary to him. Thus march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſdainfully along, and ſeeing Sir <hi>Guy</hi> in the height of Pride, he commanded him to come off his Horſe, and throw himſelf with ſubmiſſion at his Feet: But the gallant Pilgrim diſregarding his Words, commending himſelf to Heaven, put Spurs to his Horſe, and at the firſt Encounter pierced the Giant's Shield with ſuch force, that his Lance broke into Shivers, which ſo enraged the Giant, that coming up furiouſly, he killed <hi>Guy's</hi> Horſe, who being diſmounted, dangerouſly wounded <hi>Colebrand.</hi> The Combat having laſted for ſome time, the Giant fainted and fell with loſs of Blood, and <hi>Guy</hi> immediately cut off his Head, threeby freeing
<hi>England</hi> at preſent from the inſulting <hi>Dane.</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:40348:18"/>After all which he offered his Sword in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral of
<hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which was long after kept in the Veſtry, and called <hi>Colebrand's Axe.</hi> The other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of <hi>Guy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Drayton</hi> thus deſcribes:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Thy Statue,</hi> Guy, Cliff <hi>keeps, the Gazers Eyes to pleaſe;</hi>

                  <l>Warwick <hi>thy mighty Arms,</hi> (<hi>thou mighty</hi> Hercules)</l>
                  <l>

            </p>
            <p>Thus much for Earl <hi>Guy,</hi> who lived in the Year of Chriſt 929. This King
<hi>Ethelstane,</hi> by the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation of his Cup-bearer, became incenſed againſt his Brother, as if he had contrived Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt him, who therefore ordered him to be put into a ſmall Veſſel without Tackle or Oars, and ſo be expoſed to the mercy of the Sea; wherewith the young Prince was ſo overwhelm'd with ſorrow, that he threw himſelf headlong into the Sea; whoſe Ghoſt the King endeavoured to appeaſe, by a voluntary Penance of ſeven years, and building two Monaſteries. Neither did the treacherous Cup-bearer eſcape Vengeance; for on a Feſtival day, as he was buſie in waiting, one of his Feet ſlipping, he recovered himſelf by the help of the other, and thereupon pleaſantly ſaid,
<q>You may ſee now how one Brother can help another:</q> This Speech ſuddenly recalled to the King's Mind the Death of his Innocent Brother; whereupon he cauſed the Cup-bearer, who was the Procurer thereof, to be immediately executed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edmund</hi> the fifth Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> ſucceeded, and after him,
<hi>Edred,</hi> his ſixth Son: Then <hi>Edwy,</hi> or <hi>Edwin</hi> the eldeſt Son of
<hi>Edmund</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Kingston upon Thames,</hi> who was of a laſcivious temper; for it is related, That on the very Day of his Coronation, he ſuddenly left his Nobility, and went into a private Room, to debauch a great
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40348:19"/>Lady, his near Kinſwoman, whoſe Husband he ſoon after ſlew. St.
<hi>Dunſtan</hi> who was preſent, and then Abbot of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> followed the King into his Chamber, and leading him out by the Hand, accuſed him before <hi>Odo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by whom he was ſeverely reproved, and forbid him the Company of that woman. The King was hereat enraged againſt <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> and baniſhed him out of the Land, and became ſo great an Enemy to the Order of Monks, that he expelled many of them out of their Monaſteries, and put married Prieſts in their Places. The People having a great Opinion of the Holineſs of <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> and being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at the King's ſeverity toward him, and other Irregularities; they turned their Affections to <hi>Edgar</hi> his Brother, and removing
<hi>Edwin</hi> from his Princely Dignity; <hi>Edgar</hi> was made King in his ſtead: for very grief whereof he ſoon waſted away; and died in 959.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edgar</hi> was called the <hi>Peaceable:</hi> He maintained the Kingdom in great Glory and Proſperity. His Navy Royal is ſaid to conſiſt of three thouſand ſix hundred Ships, with which he every Summer ſailed round his Land, to ſecure the Sea from Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. He cauſed
<hi>Ludwal</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> to pay him three hundred Wolves yearly, inſtead of a former Tribute in Money, whereby <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> which were formerly very much over-run, were now ſo freed, that there was ſcarce a Wolf to be found alive. he was very ſevere upon his Judges, if he found them guilty of Bribery and Partiality, riding the Circuit himſelf every Year for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; Yet among all theſe Vertues, he is ſaid to be very Voluptuous, eſpecially toward Women, not ſparing the very Nuns; which ſounded ſo ill, that
<hi>Dunſtan</hi> took the boldneſs to reprove him for it; and coming into his preſence, the King in Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie roſe from his Royal Throne, to take him by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40348:19"/>the Hand, and ſeat him by him. But <hi>Dunſtan</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing the King's Hand, with a ſtern Countenance and contracted Brow ſpake thus to him:
<q>You that have not been afraid to corrupt a Virgin dedicated to Chriſt, how can you preſume to touch the Conſecrated Hands of a Biſhop? You have defiled the Spouſe of your Maker, and do you now think by your flattering ſervice to pacifie the Friend of the Bridegroom? No Sir, do not miſtake your ſelf; for I will be no friend to him who hath Chriſt for his Enemy.</q> The King thunder-ſtruck with theſe dreadful Words and touch'd with remorſe of Conſcience, fell down at the Feet of <hi>Dunſtan;</hi> who raiſing him up, began to aggravate his Crime, and finding the King pliable to his Inſtruction, he enjoyned him the following Penance for ſatisfaction;
<q>That he ſhould wear no Crown for the ſpace of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years; That he ſhould faſt twice a week; That he ſhould diſtribute his Treaſure left him by his Anceſtors liberally to the poor; That he ſhould build a Monaſtery for Nuns at <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> that ſince he had robbed God of one Virgin by his Tranſgreſſion, ſo he ſhould reſtore to him many again for the time to come; Likewiſe, That he ſhould expel Clerks or Prieſts of evil life (meaning thoſe who were married) out of the Churches, and place Monks in their room.</q> All this
<hi>Edgar</hi> performed, and the ſeven years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſt, <hi>Dunſtan</hi> (ſaith the Hiſtorian) calling the Nobility, with the Biſhops, Abbots, and Clergy together, he before all the People ſet the Crown upon the King's Head at <hi>Bath,</hi> in the thirteenth year of his Reign; <hi>Dunſtan,</hi> who it ſeems rul'd all, having hitherto hindred it. The Nun here mentioned was <hi>Wilfrid</hi> a Duke's Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:40348:20"/>Daughter, which <hi>Dunſtan</hi> being now grown goood natured, Chriſtned: The words of the Hiſtorian are theſe.
<q>The Child alſo which was gotten of the Harlot he Baptized in the Holy Fountain of Regeneration, and giving him the name of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> adopted him to be the King's Son.</q> There are abundance of ridiculous miracles related of this <hi>Dunſtan:</hi> One among many others was, That a Viſion appearing to him, required him to take up the Body of <hi>Editha</hi> the Baſtard and Canonize her for a Saint; her Tomb being accordingly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Church of
<hi>Wil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>on,</hi> where ſhe was buried, her whole Body (ſaith the Monkiſh Hiſtorian) was conſumed to Duſt, ſave only her Thumb, her Belly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereof ſhe her ſelf ſhewed the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, declaring
<q>That her Thumb remained en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, becauſe ſhe ſo often uſed to croſs her ſelf therewith, and the other Parts did ſignifie the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Abſtinence and Chaſtity.</q> With ſuch ſtuff were the People then abuſed, and perſuaded to worſhip for Saints the dead Carcaſes of thoſe that were many times of very profligate Lives while on Earth. In King
<hi>Edgar's</hi> Reign there was a great Famine, wherein <hi>Ethel wald</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> ſold away all the Church-Plate, and Veſſels of Gold and Silver, to relieve the Poor, ſaying,
<q>There was no reaſon that the ſenſeleſs Temples of God ſhould abound in Riches, and the lively Temples of the Holy Ghoſt to be in want of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After the Death of <hi>Edgar</hi> there was great Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, many of the Nobility being for
<hi>Etheldred,</hi> the true and only legitimate Heir of <hi>Edgar;</hi> but the other Nobles, and the Clergy, eſpecially <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> fearing the Married Clergy ſhould again pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, he, with ſeveral other Biſhops, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and carrying the Croſs before
<hi>Edward,</hi> brought him to the Lords, and by many Perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40348:20"/>prevailed with them to accept him for their King. He was accounted a juſt, meek Prince, and very charitable to the Poor: Yet enjoyed he the Crown but a ſhort ſpace; for in the fourth Year of his Reign, as he was Hunting near <hi>Corf-Caſtle,</hi> where his Brother
<hi>Etheldred</hi> and Queen <hi>Elfrida</hi> his Mother reſided, while he was diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and drinking on Horſeback, as the Cup was at his Mouth, a Servant of the Queens, by her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance, ſtruck him into the Back with a Knife or Dagger; at which ſetting Spurs to his Horſe to get away, and fainting with loſs of Blood, he fell from his Horſe with one Foot in the Stirrop, and was dragged up and down the Woods, till at laſt his Body was left dead at the Gate of <hi>Corf-Caſtle.</hi> When this Fact was committed the Queen was ſo ſtruck with remorſe, that to expiate her Guilt, ſhe built two Monaſteries, <hi>Almsbury</hi> and
<hi>Wormwell:</hi> For, as Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> obſerves, moſt of theſe Religious Houſes were founded either upon the account of ſome Publick or Private Murther.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward the Martyr,</hi> as he was called, being thus ſlain, <hi>Etheldred</hi> his younger Brother, the Son of <hi>Edgar</hi> and Queen <hi>Elfrida,</hi> ſucceeded. He reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirty eight years, but was very unfortunate, and full of Troubles all his time. It is related, That when Archbiſhop <hi>Dunſton</hi> Chriſtened <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> as he held him over the Font, the Child was not very cleanly, whereupon the Biſhop ſwore,
<q>By the Mother of God, this Boy will prove an unhappy and ſlothful Prince;</q> which happened accordingly. At his Coronation a Cloud appeared, half like Blood, and the other half like Fire. In his third Year the <hi>Danes</hi> Invaded the Kingdom in ſeveral places, and the King paid them forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pound yearly for his Quiet, which much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obliged his Subjects; yea, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> were ſo low, that the <hi>Danes</hi> commanded their Houſes, Wives,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40348:21"/>Daughters, and all they had: Whereupon <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> contrived, that all the <hi>Danes</hi> were maſſacred in one day: But this did more enrage them, ſo that firſt
<hi>Swain</hi> and then <hi>Canutus,</hi> came with two hundred Sail of Ships, and landed in
<hi>Cornwal,</hi> burning, and deſtroying all before him, and killing Nine hundred Monks and Nuns at one time, the King's Counſels being all betrayed by the Traytor <hi>Edrick:</hi> Whereupon he fled, with his Queen <hi>Emma</hi> and her two Sons into <hi>Normandy,</hi> to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> Duke thereof, who was her Brother. But <hi>Swain</hi> being ſoon after killed by his own men, they made his Son <hi>Canutus</hi> King. After which <hi>Ethel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred</hi> returns again to
<hi>England,</hi> and perceiving the ſeveral Treaſons againſt him, and being unable to withſtand their Fury, he ſoon after died.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edmund,</hi> the eldeſt Son alive of <hi>Etheldred,</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, ſirnamed
<hi>Ironſide,</hi> from his great Strength and Courage. He was Crowned at <hi>Kingſton:</hi> But the <hi>Danes</hi> were then ſo powerful in <hi>England,</hi> that <hi>Canutus</hi> was accepted King at <hi>Southampton,</hi> many of the Clergy and Laity ſwearing Allegiance to him; but the City of <hi>London</hi> ſtood firm for <hi>Edmund,</hi> who fought ſeveral Battles againſt the <hi>Danes,</hi> and routed <hi>Canutus</hi> four times in the plain Field, and would in likelihood have freed the Nation from the <hi>Danes,</hi> had not the ever-falſe
<hi>Edrick</hi> and other perfidious perſons of the Clergy and Laity, prevented it. At length, to avoid further Bloodſhed, they made an Agreement to divide the Kingdom betwixt them; but
<hi>Edmund</hi> enjoyed the benefit of this Accord a very ſhort time, being ſoon after murdered as he was eaſing Nature, by <hi>Edrick,</hi> and his Head preſented to <hi>Canutus,</hi> who, though he loved the Treaſon, yet commanded the Traytor to be beheaded.</p>
            <p>By the Death of <hi>Edmund,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchy came to a Period; for
<hi>Canutus,</hi> after his Death,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40348:21"/>ſeiſed upon the other half of <hi>England,</hi> none being able to withſtand; whereby the <hi>Danes</hi> made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſole Maſters of this Iſland, after it had been in poſſeſſion of the <hi>Saxons</hi> about 566 Years: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobles owning <hi>Canutus</hi> for their lawful King, and ſwearing Fealty to him at his Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>London</hi> in the year of Chriſt 1017. Though <hi>Canutus</hi> had never the better Opinion of them, conſidering, that moſt of them had ſworn Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to
<hi>Edmund</hi> their Natural Sovereign, and likewiſe that they were <hi>Engliſh</hi> Natives: He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judged them treacherous Perſons, and uſed them accordingly; for ſome he baniſhed, others he beheaded, and many by the Juſt Judgment of Heaven died ſudden Deaths.
<hi>Canutus,</hi> to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh his Government, called a Parlaiment of Biſhops, Lords, and Barons, in <hi>London,</hi> wherein many laws were ordained, and, among others, this following:
<q>We admoniſh diligently all Chriſtian Men, that they do always love God with an inward heart, and be diligently obedient to Divine Teachers, and do ſubtilly ſearch God's Learning and Laws often and daily, to the profit of themſelves: And we warn, that all Chriſtian men do learn to know at leaſt-wiſe the right Belief, and a right to underſtand the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> and the <hi>Creed,</hi> for that with the one every Chriſtian man ſhould pray unto God, and with the other ſhew forth right Belief.</q> He alſo ordained in another Parliament at
<hi>Oxford,</hi>
               <q>That both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> ſhould obſerve the laws made by King
<hi>Edgar,</hi> as judging them to be above all others moſt juſt and reaſonable.</q> He married <hi>Emma</hi> the Widow of King <hi>Etheldred,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> with this Condition, That the Iſſue of her Body by him ſhould inherit the Kingdom of <hi>England.</hi> He went to <hi>Rome</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the exceſſive Extortions of the Pope from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40348:22"/>the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Archbiſhops, upon receiving their Palls: And having reigned twenty Years over <hi>England,</hi> he died.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the former Agreement, yet <hi>Harold</hi> the Son of <hi>Canutus</hi> by
<hi>Elgina</hi> his firſt Wife, (in the abſence of <hi>Hardiknute</hi> the Son of Queen
<hi>Emma</hi>) ſucceeded his Father; and the better to ſecure himſelf, he, by the aſſiſtance of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Earl <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who had married <hi>Canutus</hi>'s Daughter, endeavours to get into his Power <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> and <hi>Alfred</hi> the two Sons of Queen <hi>Emma</hi> by King <hi>Etheldred,</hi> whom he knew had more Right than himſelf; and to that purpoſe they counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit a Letter in <hi>Emma</hi>'s name, whom <hi>Harold</hi> had abuſed, and robbed of her Jewels, the Contents whereof were to this purpoſe.</p>

<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, who vowed Revenge. This <hi>Harold,</hi> called <hi>Harefoot</hi> for his great ſwiftneſs, did not long enjoy his uſurped Dominion; for after four years he died.</p>
            <p>After which <hi>Hardiknute,</hi> the Son of <hi>Canutus</hi> and Queen <hi>Emma,</hi> who was by his Father made King or <hi>Denmark,</hi> is now by the States of the Land, both <hi>Danes</hi> and
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> invited over hither to take upon him the Government. He was a great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> by heavy Taxes, which ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them, that two of his Collectors were ſlain at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> for which their City was burnt, and their Biſhop
<hi>Alfred</hi> expelled his Office, till with Money he had purchaſed his peace. Though this King was very vicious, yet it is ſaid, he was more
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40348:23"/>kind to <hi>Edward</hi> his Half-brother, and made Earl <hi>Godwin</hi> purge himſelf for the death of Prince <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> though it is thought his bountiful Gifts to the King prevailed much more for clearing him, than his Innocence. One preſent eſpecially is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable, that is, A Ship whoſe Stern was of Gold and fourſcore Soldiers, all richly habited, within her; on their Heads they all wore guilt Burgonets, and on their Bodies a triple gilt Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergeon, about their Waſts Swords girt richly guilt, a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Battle-ax on their left Shoulders, a Target with gilt Boſſes on their left Hand, a Dart in their right, and upon their Arms Bracelets of Gold of great Value. After two years Reign <hi>Hardiknute</hi> died in the midſt of his drunken De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries, and in him ended the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Race in
<hi>England,</hi> three Kings only of that Nation Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here. This third Conqueſt was but of a ſhort continuance, yet were the <hi>Danes</hi> very inſolent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>Engliſh</hi> during that time; for if an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman</hi> and a <hi>Dane</hi> met at a Bridge, or at a Door, the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> muſt ſtand ſtill till the <hi>Dane</hi> paſt by, and if he did not then bow down very low to the <hi>Dane,</hi> he was certainly beaten and abuſed: Yea, it is related, That while the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were drinking, the <hi>Danes</hi> would ſtab them, or cut their Throats; to prevent which, when the <hi>Engliſhman</hi> drank, he deſired his next Companion to be his Surety or Pledge, from whence it is ſaid the Cuſtom of Pledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another did firſt ariſe. For theſe, and abundant greater Inſolencies, after the Death of
<hi>Hardiknute,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> were utterly driven out of <hi>England,</hi> and never again returned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Edward</hi> called the <hi>Confeſſor,</hi> ſucceeded next, in 1042. who was an abſolute <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> and the youngeſt Son of <hi>Etheldred</hi> and Queen
<hi>Emma;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing invited from <hi>Normandy</hi> by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, who diſdained the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Subjection, and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:40348:23"/>was entertained with great Joy. He firſt remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that heavy
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Tax of Forty thouſand pound a year, called <hi>Dane gilt,</hi> impoſed by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and paid forty years by all but the Clergy, who are exempted,
<q>Becauſe the Kings repoſed more confidence in the Prayers of the Holy Church, than in the Power of Armies.</q> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, <hi>Edward</hi> forgave that Tax upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: A great Sum of that Treaſure being brought into his Chamber, and laid in a heap, he being called to ſee it, was at firſt ſight much affrighted, proteſting he ſaw the Devil dancing with great Joy upon the ſame; and therefore commanded it ſhould be again reſtored to his Subjects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed them from it for ever after. He married <hi>Editha</hi> Earl <hi>Godwin's</hi> Daughter, but never had any Conjugal Society with her, though ſhe was a Lady accompliſhed with all excellent Endowments both of Mind and Body, ſo that this old Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="5 letters">

               <hi>Edward</hi> himſelf confeſſed upon his Death-bed, That openly ſhe was his Wife, but in ſecret Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracings as his own Siſter: But whether it were Infirmity or Chaſtity, it ſeems he was willing to have her accuſed of Incontinency, whereof if ſhe were guilty, he could not be innocent, it being a great injury to put his Wives vertue to ſo Tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal a trial. After this, ſome differences aroſe between him and Earl <hi>Godwin,</hi> and Forces were raiſed on both ſides, but by the Interceſſion of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, an Agreement was made: Yet
<hi>Godwin</hi> eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not Divine Vengeance; for being charged by
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:40348:24"/>the King for the Munder of <hi>Alfred,</hi> he wiſhed if he were guilty he might never ſwallow down a bit of Bread again; which happened accordingly; for the firſt bit of Bread he put into his Mouth choaked him; as he ſate with the King at Table: A dreadful Inſtance of God's Severity againſt Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This King is blamed for his Cruelty to his Mother, in forcing her to paſs over nine burning Plow ſhares, bare-foot and blind-fold, for a Trial of her Continency; which yet ſhe performed without the leaſt damage. He is ſaid to be the firſt King that cured the Diſeaſe called the <hi>King's-Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is related, that this King lying on his Bed one Afternoon, with the Curtains drawn, a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Courtier coming into his Chamber, and finding the King's Casket open, which
<hi>Hugoline</hi> his Chamberlain had forgot to ſhut, he took out as

               </gap> Money as he could well carry, and went away: But finding ſucceſs, he came a ſecond, and a third time, ſtill carrying off more. At which the King, who had obſerved all, called to him to be gone with all ſpeed, ſince he had enough, if he could be contented;
<q>For, ſaid he, if <hi>Hugoline</hi> ſhould come and catch thee, thou wilt go nigh to loſe all thou haſt got, and may'ſt get a Halter into the Bargain:</q> The Fellow was no ſooner gone, but <hi>Hugoline</hi> came in; and finding the Casket open, and a great deal of Money taken out, he was much incenſed: But the King bid him not be moved;
<q>For, ſaid he, he that hath it, hath more need of it than we.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When this King <hi>Edward</hi> was haſtning out of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi> with a great Army to recover <hi>England</hi> from the <hi>Danes,</hi> being ready to give Battel, his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains aſſured him of Victory, and that they would not leave one <hi>Dane</hi> alive:
<q>God forbid, ſaid <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> that the Kingdom ſhould be recovered
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:40348:24"/>for me, who am but one Man, by the death of ſo many thouſands; better it is that I ſhould live a private and unbloody Life, than to be a King by ſuch a Slaughter and Butchery.</q> This King having no liſue of his own, ſent for <hi>Edward</hi> the Son of
<hi>Edmund Ironſide</hi> out of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who for his long abſence was called <hi>the Outlaw;</hi> but he dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoon after, he declared <hi>Edgar</hi> the <hi>Outlaw</hi>'s Son, to be Heir, and ſirnamed him <hi>Atheling,</hi> or <hi>Adeling,</hi> a Term appropriated to the preſumptive Heirs of the Crown. He had alſo a Daughter named <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilda,</hi> who was married to the King of <hi>Scots,</hi> and was Mother to <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and
<hi>Maud</hi> Queen of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When King <hi>Edward</hi> was on his Death-bed he obſerved all preſent weeping and lamenting for him, to whom he ſaid,
<q>If you loved me, you would forbear weeping and rejoyce; becauſe I go to my Father, with whom I ſhall receive the Joys promiſed to the Faithful, not through my Merits, but by the free mercy of my Saviour, who ſheweth mercy on who he pleaſeth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After the Death of Earl <hi>Godwin, Harold</hi> his Son grew into great Favour with King
<hi>Edward,</hi> and was by him made Lieutenant of his Army againſt the <hi>Welch;</hi> who, with his Brother <hi>Toſto,</hi> or <hi>Toſton,</hi> utterly ſubdued that Rebellion. After which,
<hi>Harold</hi> ſtill increaſing more in favour with the King, there grew ſuch hatred between the two Brethren, that <hi>Toſto</hi> coming to <hi>Hereford,</hi> ſlew all his Brother's Servants, and cutting them in pieces, ſalted them, and put them into powdering-tubs.

<hi>Wiliam,</hi> he made him promiſe, That after the death of King <hi>Edward,</hi> he would ſecure the Kingdom for him, according to King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Will: Which Oath
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40348:25"/>having taken, <hi>Harold</hi> came back, and told King <hi>Edward</hi> what he had done, who ſeemed well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent therewith, ſaith the Hiſtorian; which, if it were true, he had ſurely forgot his former Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration concerning <hi>Edgar Atheling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, after the death of King <hi>Edward, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold</hi> neither regarding his Oath to Duke
<hi>William,</hi> nor <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Right, whom he diſpiſed for his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Age, cauſed himſelf to be Proclaimed King, without any great Ceremony or Celebration, none much approving or diſapproving thereof: and to ingratiate himſelf with the People, he eaſed them of ſeveral ſevere Taxes laid upon them by his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, and was affable and kind to all: But this was a ſhort calm before a great ſtorm; for ſoon after Duke <hi>William</hi> ſent his Ambaſſadors to him to mind him of his Oath; but he returned anſwer,
<q>That it was extorted from him in his Impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and therefore was no way obliging.</q> At this Anſwerthe Duke was much inraged and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Forces for gaining the Kingdom by force. Neither was <hi>Harold</hi> idle, but made proviſion to withſtand him: At which time a dreadful Comet appeared in the Heavens, which was then judged and after proved to be a fatal Omen.</p>
            <p>During theſe Preparations, <hi>Toſto</hi> Brother to <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> and <hi>Harfager</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> with three hundred Ships, invaded the Country; landing in
<hi>Yorkſhire, Harfager</hi> claiming the Crown as Son of <hi>Canutus;</hi> but the Nobility of thoſe parts oppoſing them, were routed: which <hi>Harold</hi> hearing, march'd againſt them, and at <hi>Stamford</hi>-Bridge he encountred them, where his whole Army was withſtood by one ſingle <hi>Dane,</hi> who ſlew forty of his men and made good the Bridge, till a Soldier in a Boat rowing under the Bridge, thruſt his Spear through a crevice and ſo ſlew this valiant Champion: After which, the King fell upon the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40348:25"/>
               <hi>Danes</hi> and got an intire Victory over them, killing King
<hi>Harfager,</hi> and <hi>Toſto</hi> his own Brother: <hi>Olave</hi> the Son of
<hi>Harfager,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> Earl of <hi>Orkney,</hi> were taken Priſoners, with abundance more, who beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their Lives, the King ordered 20 of their 300 Ships to carry them to
<hi>Denmark,</hi> with the ſad news of the loſs of their King and his whole Army.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was this Storm over, but a worſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; for Duke <hi>William</hi> having prepared a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and Navy, reſolved for <hi>England,</hi> having the free conſent of his Nobility for his Voyage, many of them aſſiſting him therein. But firſt he ſent to Pope
<hi>Alexander</hi> to confirm his Title to the Crown, who did it readily, and withal ſent him a Conſecrated banner, an <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> and a Hair of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> with a curſe to all oppoſers to carry in the Ship wherein he himſelf failed. Being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly furniſhed he and his Men embarqued at St. <hi>Vallery,</hi> where they ſtaid a long time for a Wind; at length ſetting Sail, <hi>Sep.</hi> 28. 1066. he arrived with his Fleet at <hi>Pevenſey</hi> in
<hi>Suſſex,</hi> where as ſoon as he landed, it hapned one of his Feet ſtuck ſo faſt in the Sand that he fell to the ground; whereupon one of his Attendants catching him by the Arm, and helping him up, ſaid,
<q>Stand up my Lord; and be of good Courage, for now you have taken faſt footing in
<hi>England;</hi>
               </q> and obſerving that he had taken up Sand and Earth in his Hand, he added,
<q>You have now taken Livery and Seiſin of the Country;</q> it being the cuſtom, that when Poſſeſſion is taken of Land, a piece of Earth is given to the Poſſeſſor. A Wizard or Necroman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer had told Duke <hi>William,</hi> That he ſhould ſafely arrive in
<hi>England</hi> with his whole Army, without any hindrance from <hi>Harold;</hi> which after it came to paſs, King <hi>William</hi> ſent for this Conjurer, to confer further with him; but it was told him, That he was drowned in that Ship which alone of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40348:26"/>the whole Navy miſcarried; whereupon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror ſaid,
<q>He would never put confidence in that Science which was of more benefit to the Ignorant than the Skilful therein; for it ſeems he could foreſee my good fortune, but not his own misfortune.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After his Landing, the Duke ſet all his Ships a fire, to aſſure his men that they muſt either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer or die. He then marched towards <hi>Haſtings,</hi> declaring the cauſe of his coming to be to inherit the Kingdom, which was given him by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and ſtrictly charging his Soldiers not to wrong any of the People in the leaſt, ſince they were ſo ſoon to become his Natural Subjects. He then ſent Meſſengers to <hi>Harold,</hi> either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him up the Country, and be ſubject to him, or to fight it out in the ſight of both Armies in ſingle combat; or laſtly, to ſtand to the Pope's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination: But he returned anſwer,
<q>That unleſs he did ſuddenly depart, he would give him cauſe to repent this his raſh Invaſion; and that the next day it ſhould he tryed by more Swords than One.</q> Accordingly
<hi>Harold</hi> marcheth couragiouſly againſt Duke <hi>Widiam,</hi> who put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into a poſture to receive him. It happned, that the Morning before the Battel, <hi>William's</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mourer by miſtake put on his Back-piece before, and his Breaſt-plate behind; which being obſerved by ſome of his Attendants, was judged an ill Omen, and therefore they adviſed him not to fight that day: To whom the Duke replied,
<q>I value not ſuch Fooleries; but if I have any skill in Soothſaying, (as in truth I have none) I am of the opinion if doth foretel, that I ſhall change my Condition, and of a D. ſhall this day become a K.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Armies being Marſhalled, <hi>Harold</hi> placing the <hi>Kentiſh-men</hi> with their heavy Axes or Halberts in the Van, the Battel began, both Parties fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40348:26"/>bravely, one for the Liberty of their Country, and the other for a Kingdom. The
<hi>Normans</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving they could not break the united ſtrength of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> pretended to fly, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> believing, purſued them in diſorder, whereupon the <hi>Normans</hi> taking the advantage, rallied, and charging them furiouſly in that disjoynted Poſture, made a very great ſlaughter among the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and among the reſt, King <hi>Harold,</hi> his Brother, and moſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, fell that day; and of the Common Souldiers, Sixty ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand nine hundred ſeventy four. Others report, an hundred thouſand were ſlain. Duke <hi>William</hi> had three Horſes killed under him, yet received not the leaſt wound, his Loſs being only, as is ſaid, Six thouſand Men. Thus died King <hi>Harold,</hi> after only nine Months Reign, and was buried at <hi>Waltham</hi> Abby in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> And it is very remarkable, That whereas <hi>Harold,</hi> with his Father <hi>Godwin,</hi> had cruelly murdered <hi>Alfred</hi> the true Heir to the Crown, and his
<hi>Normans,</hi> he was now by a <hi>Norman</hi> Wounded in the left Eye with an Arrow, whereof he immediately died. This great Battel was fought at <hi>Haſtings</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> on
<hi>Saturday, October</hi> 14. 1066. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> after this vaſt loſs had deſigned to make <hi>Edgar Atheling</hi> King, but it was prevented by their private Animoſities. And thus ended the <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchy in <hi>England,</hi> which from <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt</hi> in 475 to this Year, had continued (ſave only ſome ſhort interruptions by the <hi>Danes</hi>) Five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ninety one years.</p>
            <p>During theſe ſtupendious Revolutions in the State and Government of <hi>England,</hi> we do not read of much action between the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and the <hi>Saxons, Danes</hi> and
<hi>Normans;</hi> It is recorded they had ſtill a Succeſſion of Kings and Princes, and among them <hi>Leoline ap Sytſill</hi> who lived about the year 900, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> Sirnamed the Elder, a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40348:27"/>
               <hi>Saxon</hi> King, and yet free from Pride or Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, (ſaith the Hiſtorian) as appears by the intercourſe betwixt him and this <hi>Leoline,</hi> who after ſeveral Skirmiſhes thought fit to Treat of Peace; The King lay at a place called
<hi>Auſteline,</hi> and the Prince at <hi>Betheſly</hi> not far diſtant; <hi>Leoline</hi> thought it below him to croſs the <hi>Severn</hi> to wait upon <hi>Edward,</hi> whereupon the King went into a Boat to come over to him; <hi>Leoline</hi> obſerving it, and ſurprized at this great condiſcention, upon the King's approach to the oppoſite ſhoar, threw off this rich Robe he had on, prepared on purpoſe for that Royal Aſſembly, and entred the Water Breaſt high, where imbracing the Boat he ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſaid,
<q>Moſt Prudent and Worthy King, your Humility hath overcome my Inſolence, and your Wiſdom hath Triumphed over my Folly, Come, tread upon my Neck which I have fooliſhly lifted up againſt you, and enter into my Country this Day with all freedom, ſince your generoſity hath made it all your own.</q> Having ſaid this, he took the King upon his Shoulders, and carrying him aſhoar cauſed him to ſit down upon his Royal Robe, and ſo putting his hands jointly into his, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Homage and Allegiance to him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ethelſtane</hi> his Succeſſor had Wars with the <hi>Welſh,</hi> whoſe Princes and Rulers he brought to be his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butaries, who at <hi>Hereford</hi> entred into Covenants to pay him yearly twenty pound weight in Gold, three hundred weight of Silver, and two thouſand five hundred Head of Cattel, with a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Hawks and Hounds; Toward the payment of which, by the Statutes of <hi>Howel Dha,</hi> the King of <hi>Aberfraw</hi> was charged at ſixty ſix pounds, the Prince of <hi>Dynever</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Powys</hi> the like Sums. This
<hi>Ethelſtane</hi> confined the <hi>Britains</hi> (who hitherto had enjoyed the City of
<hi>Exeter</hi> with the ſame right as the <hi>Saxons</hi>) into the furtheſt Promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:40348:27"/>of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> enlarging his Dominions beyond any <hi>Saxon</hi> King before him.</p>
            <p>In the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor 1053, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> with 36 Ships entred the River <hi>Severne,</hi> and with the aſſiſtance of <hi>Griffith</hi> King or Prince of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> burnt and deſtroyed all they met with; Againſt whom
<hi>Alfred</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> marching with conſiderable force, was defeated, many of his Souldiers being ſlain, and the reſt put to flight, which much elevated the
<hi>Welſh,</hi> ſo that <hi>Rice</hi> the Brother of <hi>Griffith</hi> made many Incurſions into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Territories, and carried away great Booties, till at length he was routed and ſlain at <hi>Bulenden,</hi> and his Head preſented to King <hi>Edward</hi> at
<hi>Gloceſter.</hi> Two years after the King having baniſhed <hi>Algar</hi> the Son of

<hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter.</hi> King <hi>Stephen</hi> Beſieged <hi>Ramilph</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and Earl <hi>Robert</hi> in <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who iſſued out of the City reſolving to give the King Battel, being aſſiſted with a great number of

<hi>Robert</hi> the Baſtard their General, ſays he, but a boaſting Coward who can ſpeak big, but perform little, hath a Lion's Voice, but the Heart of an Hare? and what is
<hi>Cheſter's</hi> Earl but an hair-brain'd audacious man, without Judgment or Courage? and what are the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> which he has with him, are they not fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for our contempt than fear? who being naked, unarmed and without any military Diſcipline, run headlong like wild Beaſts upon the Javelins and Spears of the Hunter; and the reſt are only

Yet he afterward regained his Liberty and his Crown, and Died a King after having Reigned near 19 years.</p>
            <p>In 1170.

            <p>In 1199.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:40348:30"/>but becauſe the King who was there, went not out of the City in Perſon to meet him as his Father <hi>Henry</hi> had done, (though Earl <hi>John</hi> the King's Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had conducted him from the Marſhes with all the marks of honour and eſteem) this haughty

            <p>In 1211. <hi>Leolin ap Jorwith</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> (though he had a while before made his ſubmiſſion to King <hi>John</hi>) plundred ſeveral <hi>Engliſh</hi> Towns in the Marſhes, which cauſed the King to raiſe a great Army to reduce him to obedience, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Leoline</hi> ordered all his People to convey their Cattel and Goods of Value, to the almoſt inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible places upon <hi>Snowdon Hills:</hi> however the <hi>Engliſh</hi> purſued them with ſo much ſpeed, vigor, and revenge for their continual loſſes, that their Prince and Chief Lords were compelled to accept of what terms the King would allow them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were obliged (both by Oath, Homage and Hoſtages, and likewiſe by granting all their Lands to the King, to be held of him forever) to buy their peace, and ſave themſelves from being utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extirpated out of their Country.</p>

               </gap>erobbed and murdered, which the <hi>Welſh</hi> would by no means permit, falling upon the Souldiers and driving them into the Caſtle; Upon which the King
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40348:31"/>Marches thither, and not only ſuppreſſeth theſe Mutineers, but ſets the whole Forreſt in a Flame; From hence he pierceth farther into <hi>Wales,</hi> and burns a place called <hi>Cridia,</hi> and then begins to raiſe a new Fort for bridling the Natives, which whilſt he was doing <hi>David</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward him with his Forces, being encouraged by many great men in King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Army, who were confederates with him, and a great Battel was fought where many were ſlain on both ſides, and afterward by the treachery of theſe <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barons, Proviſions grew ſo very ſcare that the King was compelled to yield to a diſhonourable Peace, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To raze to the ground the new Fort, now almoſt finiſht, That <hi>William Bruce</hi> a valiant Commander taken in the Fight, ſhould continue Priſoner du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Prince <hi>David</hi>'s Pleaſure, Laſtly, That <hi>David</hi> ſhould pay the King only three thouſand Marks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the charges of the War.</p>
            <p>About a year after Prince <hi>David</hi> made another Inſurrection in revenge of thoſe
<hi>Welſhmens</hi> Heads whom <hi>Hubert de Burg</hi> had cauſed to be ſtruck off in cold Blood, and preſented to the King, for which <hi>David</hi> burnt ſeveral Churches and many Ladies in them, whereupon he was ſolemnly Curſed and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated at <hi>Oxford</hi> in the preſence of all the Nobility, and Clergy, and the King raiſing a great Army went to repreſs the <hi>Welſh,</hi> but returned without effecting it; So that they continued their ravages more than ever; Complaints whereof coming daily to the King, the Lords of his Council told him how pernicious it would be to him to ſuffer it, who replied, That he was not able to ſuppreſs them for want of money; They being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious at his kindneſs to <hi>Hubert de Burg,</hi> boldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, He might well be poor who gave away his Eſtate to make others Rich and Great, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they drew up many Articles againſt <hi>de Burg,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40348:31"/>one whereof was, That he had ſtoln out of the King's Jewel Office a precious Stone of wonderful value, which had virtue to make him that wore it Invincible in Battel, and that he had given this Stone to <hi>David</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> the King's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; Another was, That he by his Letters had cauſed Prince <hi>David</hi> to hang the gallant <hi>William Bruce;</hi> But he defeated all their deſigns againſt him, and recovered the King's favour.</p>
            <p>Afterward Prince <hi>David</hi> joined with the Earl <hi>Marſhall</hi> in a Rebellion againſt the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated his Forces; But the King at length recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his power there, and giving himſelf up to Works of Charity and Hoſpitality cauſed Prince <hi>David</hi> to uſe this notable expreſſion, <hi>I more fear ſaith he, the Almſdeeds which the King doth than all the men of War that he hath, and the whole Clergy put together;</hi> After this having taken Homage of all his Nobility, Prince <hi>David</hi> voluntarily offered to hold his whole Principality of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (though with the diſlike of his People) that he might thereby ſtrengthen himſelf againſt the attempts of his Son <hi>Griffith,</hi> who uſed great endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to deprive him of his Royalty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Griffith</hi> ſucceeded him, and being taken Priſoner by King <hi>Henry</hi> was committed to the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> from whence endeavouring to make his eſcape over the Walls, by tying the Sheets and Blankets of his Bed together, the weight of his heavy Body looſed them, and falling down upon his Head he broke his Neck.</p>
            <p>Afterward his Son <hi>David</hi> being provoked by the many injuries received from the Earl of
<hi>Hereford,</hi> made an Inroad into the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marſhes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to have freed himſelf from all Homage to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> exhibiting his complaint to the Pope, and alledging, That he was by force and violence unjuſtly compelled to hold his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:40348:32"/>and Eſtate of them; But the King's Credit and Power prevailed againſt the weak Allegations of this poor Prince, who thereupon continued his depredations; Againſt whom King
<hi>Henry</hi> ſent three hundred men at Arms under the Command of Sir <hi>Hubert Fitz Matthew,</hi> but through his own raſhneſs, and the valour of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> he and his Party were totally defeated; At which the King being much troubled, reſolved to go againſt them in Perſon, and after he had fortified the Caſtle of <hi>Grennock</hi> in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and waſted the Iſle of <hi>Angleſey</hi> he was forced by the rigour of the Weather to return home, endeavouring to ſtarve the <hi>Welſh,</hi> by prohibiting the <hi>Iriſh</hi> and
<hi>Cheſhire</hi> men under ſevere penalties to furniſh them with any provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and if any of them ventured out of their Faſtneſſes on <hi>Snowdon Hills,</hi> to ſatisfie their hunger the Garriſon of <hi>Grennock</hi> were ready to ſurprize them; Yea the two
<hi>Welſh</hi> Lords <hi>Powys</hi> and <hi>Brom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> joined with the King againſt them, inſomuch that they were in miſerable diſtreſs, about which time Prince <hi>David</hi> died.</p>
            <p>In 1255. The <hi>Welſh</hi> being oppreſt by <hi>Geffery Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> Governor of the Marſhes fled to Arms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Prince <hi>Edward</hi> (afterward King <hi>Edward</hi> I.) to whom his Father had given that Principality, raiſes an Army to ſubdue them, and wanting Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney borrowed large ſums of his Uncle <hi>Richard,</hi> and then Marches againſt Prince
<hi>Leoline,</hi> whoſe Forces conſiſted in about Ten Thouſand Country Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and many more Foot, who took a Solemn Oath, That they would ſtand together for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery and defence of their Antient Laws, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Countrey, counting it better to loſe their Lives with Honour, than to live in Ignominy and Slavery; And indeed they had already performed very notable enterpriſes under the conduct of their valiant Prince, having recovered all the Inland
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:40348:32"/>Country of <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and in one Battel kill'd above a thouſand
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> putting the reſt to flight, and making Irruptions to the very Walls of
<hi>Cheſter;</hi> Neither had Prince <hi>Edward</hi> any better ſucceſs, for <hi>Leoline</hi> fell upon his Army with ſuch Courage as obliged them to retire and not attempt any thing farther againſt him, who complaining to his Father of the diſgrace he had received; <hi>What's that to me</hi> (ſays K. <hi>Henry</hi>) I have given the Country to thee, and thou muſt uſe thy courage to defend it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by gain ſuch honour in thy Youth, that afterward thine Enemies may ſtand in fear of thee; As for me I have ſomewhat elſe to do. In the abſence of Prince
<hi>Edward, Leoline</hi> and his <hi>Welſh</hi> Forces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued their ravages on the Marſhes; He likewiſe Confederated with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Barons then in Arms againſt King
<hi>Henry</hi> whom they had defeated and taken Priſoner in a bloody Battel at <hi>Lewes</hi> in
<hi>Suſſex,</hi> and carried into <hi>Wales</hi> with them, deſtroying the Lands of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> in the Counties of <hi>Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Glamorgan,</hi> under the command of Prince <hi>Leoline</hi> and <hi>Simon Montfort</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> Prince
<hi>Edward</hi> perceiving that he muſt uſe his utmoſt power for the recovery of his Father's Liberty, and the Kingdom, reſolved with the aſſiſtance of the People of <hi>Cheſhire, Herefordſhire, Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire</hi> (who had been great ſufferers in theſe publick calamities) to give the Rebels Battel, which he did accordingly in a large Plain near the Town of <hi>Everſham</hi> in <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> where the Army of the Barons was utterly diſcomfited with a very great ſlaughter, eſpecially of the <hi>Welſh; Simon Montfort</hi> called the Great Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> was alſo ſlain; at which very minute there was ſuch terrible Thunder, Lightning and Darkneſs as cauſed much amazement. After the Death of <hi>Montfort,</hi> Prince <hi>Leoline</hi> who had given him great aſſiſtance, thought fit to make a reconciliation with King <hi>Henry,</hi> and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40348:33"/>by paying thirty thouſand pound Sterling, four <hi>Welſh</hi> Counties taken from him in the Wars, were reſtored to him.</p>
            <p>In 1275. King <hi>Edward</hi> I. ſent for Prince <hi>Leoline</hi> to attend at his Coronation and do him Homage, which he excuſed or modeſtly refuſed; He was afterward ſummoned to appear at the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> which he likewiſe declined, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon terms of ſafe Conduct, doubting to be uſed, as he pretended, like his Grandfather
<hi>Griffith,</hi> whom he intimated was murdered in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and not kill'd by accident: yet he ſent a meſſage to the Archbiſhops of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and
<hi>York,</hi> That if the King pleaſed to appoint Commiſſioners to receive his Oath and Homage he was very ready to give it, or if he would name ſome indifferent place and give Prince
<hi>Edward,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and the Lord Chancellor as Hoſtages for his ſafe return, he would wait upon him in Perſon; The King diſſembled his anger at theſe arrogant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but a while after coming to the Caſtle of <hi>Cheſter</hi> on the Border of
<hi>Wales,</hi> he again ſent for him, and <hi>Leoline</hi> again denied to come; At which the King reſolved, for preventing all future diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances on that ſide, to make an abſolute Conqueſt of the Countrey; And on the contrary the <hi>Welſh</hi> having always a cuſtom at every change of Princes in <hi>England</hi> to try concluſions, expecting one time or other to change their Yoke of Bondage into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, were in great hopes of doing it at this time, having now a valiant Prince to command them; But an accident happened which ſomewhat took off their edge, for the Lady <hi>Eleanor</hi> Daughter of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Earl of <hi>Montfort,</hi> whom Prince <hi>Leoline</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved Sailing out of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Wales,</hi> was by the way taken by ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships, and brought to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and for the Love of her, Prince <hi>Leoline</hi> was willing to ſubmit to any conditions, ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40348:33"/>that beſides his Promiſe of ſubmiſſion to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he agreed to pay down Fifty thouſand pounds Sterling, and a thouſand pound a year during life; Upon theſe Terms he Married his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lady, and the Wedding was ſolemniz'd in <hi>England,</hi> the King and Queen being preſent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; Three years <hi>Leoline</hi> continued faithful and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, in which time <hi>David</hi> one of his Brothers, ſtaying in <hi>England,</hi> and being found by the King to be of a ſtirring Spirit, was much honoured by him, Knighted and Match to a Rich Widow, Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> to which the King added the gift of the Caſtle of <hi>Denbigh</hi> with a thouſand pound a year, though it was at length diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that he lived here only as a Spy; For Prince <hi>Leoline's</hi> Lady dying ſoon after, and he contrary to his engagements taking up Arms, his Brother <hi>David</hi> notwithſtanding theſe favours from the King, went and joined with him, and they together en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into <hi>England</hi> ſeizing the Caſtles of <hi>Flint</hi> and <hi>Ruthland</hi> with the Perſon of the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Clifford</hi> who was ſent thither as a Judge, and in a great Battel the

            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> was at the Vizes in <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> when news coming of this revolt and overthrow, he raiſes an Army to revenge it; In his way he goes to viſit his Mother Queen
<hi>Eleanor,</hi> who lay at the Nunnery of <hi>Almesbury,</hi> with whom while he was diſcourſing a Perſon was brought into the Chamber, who pretended that being formerly blind he had received his Sight at the Tomb of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. When the King ſaw him, he knew him, and that he was a moſt notorious lying Villain, and intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Mother not to give the leaſt credit to him: but the Queen who was glad to hear of this Miracle for the glory of her Husband, finding her Son un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40348:34"/>that his Father ſhould be a Saint, fell ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly into ſuch a rage, that ſhe commanded him out of her ſight, which the King obeys, and going forth meets with a Clergyman to whom he tells the ſtory of this Impoſtor, adding merrily, <hi>That he knew the Juſtice of his Father to be ſuch, that he would rather pluck out the Eyes, being whole, of ſuch a wicked wretch, than reſtore him to his ſight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> went of himſelf to Prince
<hi>Leoline</hi> and his Brother <hi>David,</hi> endeavouring to perſuade them to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but in vain: for <hi>Leoline</hi> was ſo animated with an old
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Prophecy of <hi>Merlin's, That he ſhould ſhortly be Crowned with the Diadem of Brute,</hi> that he had no Ear for Peace, and ſhortly after no head, for the Earl of
<hi>Pembroke</hi> firſt took <hi>Bere</hi> Caſtle which was his uſual reſidence from him, he then gave him Battel, and his Party being defeated, his Head was cut off by a Common Souldier and ſent to King <hi>Edward,</hi> who cauſed it to be Crowned with Ivy, thereby in ſome part unluckily fulfilling his <hi>Welſh</hi> Prediction. And this was the end of <hi>Leoline</hi> the laſt of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Princes, betrayed, as ſome write, by the men of <hi>Buelth.</hi> Soon after his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>David</hi> flying into <hi>Wales,</hi> and being deſtitute of help or relief, he was at length taken with two of his Sons and ſeven Daughters (as ſome Authors write) all which were brought before the King; <hi>David</hi> was committed to <hi>Cheſter</hi> Caſtle, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in a Parliament at <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> was convicted of Treaſon, and ſentenced to an ignominious death, namely, to be firſt drawn at a Horſe Tail about the City of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> then to be beheaded and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, his Heart and Bowels burnt; His Head to accompany his Brothers was put upon the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> and his four Quarters were ſet up in four Cities, <hi>Briſtol, Northampton, York</hi> and <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> A manifold Execution and the firſt ſhewed in this
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40348:34"/>kind in this Kingdom, in the Perſon of the Son of a Prince, or any other Nobleman that we read of in our Hiſtory. Some have obſerved that upon King <hi>Edward</hi>'s thus totally ſubjecting <hi>Wales,</hi> he loſt his Eldeſt Son <hi>Alphonſus</hi> a Prince of great hopes, about twelve years of Age, and had only left to ſucceed him his Son
<hi>Edward</hi> lately born at <hi>Carnar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van,</hi> and the firſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Royal Families that was Intituled Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> but no Prince worthy either of <hi>Wales</hi> or <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, the reſt of the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> as well Nobles as others ſubmitted themſelves to King <hi>Edward,</hi> and all the Countrey and Caſtles therein were ſurrendred to him, who then annexed that Country to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and built two ſtrong Caſtles at <hi>Aberconway</hi> and <hi>Carnarvan</hi> to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their obedience; He alſo gave ſeveral Lands and Caſtels to <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> as the Lordſhip of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>high</hi> to <hi>Henry Lacy</hi> Earl of <hi>Lincoln;</hi> Of <hi>Ruthen</hi> to <hi>Reginald</hi> Lord
<hi>Grey,</hi> and divided <hi>Wales</hi> into Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Hundreds, eſtabliſhing the Government thereof agreeable to the Laws of <hi>England;</hi> This happened in the twelfth year of his Reign, 1284.</p>

            <head type="sub">PART. II.</head>
            <p>THough King <hi>Edward</hi> I. had ſubjected the Principality of <hi>Wales,</hi> and afterward annexed it to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> yet he could never induce that People freely to own him as their King, but upon condition that he would come and reſide among them, or at leaſt appoint them a Prince of their own Nation to Govern them; for the <hi>Welch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> having experienced the rigorous and ſevere Treatment of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Governours, and being ſenſible that the King would rule them by an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Deputy, they could not with patience bear the thoughts of it, ſo that oftentimes when the King charged them with affronting his Lord Lieutenants, they unanimouſly anſwered, That they were very willing to be ſubject to any Prince he ſhould nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, provided he were a <hi>Welſhman</hi> born.</p>
            <p>The King perceiving their inflexible temper, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to gratifie them by a Politick Stratagem; He thereupon ſends ſecretly to the Queen who was then big with Child, that ſhe ſhould come to him with all ſpeed to <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> and when ſhe was nigh
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40348:35"/>her time of Delivery, He ordered all the <hi>Welſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry to appear before him at <hi>Ruth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Caſtle to conſult about the Publick welfare of their Country; When they were come he detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them till he had notice that the Queen was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of a Son at <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> and then calling them together, he told them, That they having often Petitioned him to have a Prince to rule them, he being now going out of their Countrey would nominate one to them, provided they would promiſe to accept and obey him. The <hi>Welſhmen</hi> anſwered they would be willingly obedient to him, provided he were their own Countryman; Ay, ſays the King, I will aſſure you that he was born in <hi>Wales;</hi> That he can ſpeak never a word of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and that he never did any wrong to man, Woman or Child; The
<hi>Welſhmen</hi> were very joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of their good fortune, promiſing true ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; Whereupon he named his own new born Son <hi>Edward,</hi> firnamed <hi>Carnarvan</hi> from the place of his Birth, and from that time the Eldeſt Sons of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have been Intituled Princes of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Prince ſucceeded his Father by the name of King <hi>Edward</hi> II. He was a comely Perſon, and of great ſtrength, but much given to Drink, which made him often diſcloſe his Secrets; For his other conditions, his greateſt fault was his inordinate love to
<hi>Gareſtone</hi> and the <hi>Spencers,</hi> who being Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of lewd Lives, endeavoured to debauch him with Wine and Women, and occaſioned many miſchiefs and grievances in the Kingdom, of which the Nobility and People were ſo ſenſible, that when they found him irreclaimable, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to depoſe him and ſet his young Son <hi>Edward</hi> on the Throne, his Queen likewiſe joining with the Lords therein, who going over to <hi>France,</hi> ſhe there Contracted a Marriage between her Son <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:40348:36"/>and <hi>Philippa</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Heynault,</hi> by whom being aided with Forces, ſhe landed at <hi>Orwell</hi> near <hi>Harwich</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> The Lords imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſorted to her, and the <hi>Londoners</hi> inclining to take her part, the King found his evil Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors the <hi>Spencers</hi> and others could do him little ſervice; Therefore Shiping themſelves for the Iſle of <hi>Lundy,</hi> they were by Tempeſt caſt upon the Coaſt of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the King ſecured himſelf in a Monaſtery in
<hi>Glamorganſhire;</hi> But ſoon after both he and his Favourites were taken from thence. They were Hanged and Quartered, and he himſelf was depoſed by Parliament, having been firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to make a formal reſignation of the Crown; And at length he was committed a Priſoner to <hi>Berkley</hi> Caſtle near <hi>Briſtol,</hi> where he was miſerably murdered, by having a red hot Iron or Spit thruſt up into his Body.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> ſo called from the place of his Birth, the Son of this unfortunate King was the ſecond Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Royal Blood. Upon the Depoſing of his Father by the Parliament, it was reſolved that he ſhould be advanced to the Throne, which this young Prince refuſed, unleſs his Father reſigned the Government, which he was obliged to do, and ſo his Son was Proclaimed King by the name of <hi>Edward</hi> III. who afterward proved a Glorious and Renowned Prince. His
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority</hi> (being but four years old when he was Crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) though it may Palliate, cannot ſo take off the ſcandal of not preventing his Death who gave him Life, but that there remains a great blemiſh upon his memory; For being a Maſter of ſo much reaſon as to pauſe upon it, as he did, upon the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of putting his Father to Death, it may be thought he had power enough to have prevented the execution, it being a violation of the Law of Nature, and likewiſe of ill example, ſince the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40348:36"/>People might uſe him in the ſame manner if he outlived their affections, or his own diſcretion; But his revenge upon <hi>Mortimer</hi> ſeems to declare him really innocent, or that he abhor'd the World ſhould think otherwiſe; Whereby he ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled himſelf to the opinion of the Vulgar, that he ſeldom wanted Friends during his long Reign, as he never wanted an occaſion to make uſe of them.</p>
            <p>He was a Prince of that admirable compoſure of Body and Mind, that Fortune ſeemed to have fallen in love with him, elevating him ſo far above the reach of Envy or Treachery, that all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Princes dazled with the ſplendor of his Glory gave place to him, who from the very firſt Aſcent to the Throne, had a proſpect of two Crowns more than he was born to; The one placed within his reach, which was <hi>Scotland,</hi> The other that of <hi>France</hi> which was more remote; To the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt there was a fair opportunity offered by the irreconcileable conteſt of two Rival Kings, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Bruce,</hi> and <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> whoſe Right and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt were ſo evenly poized, that King <hi>Edward</hi>'s power could eaſily turn the Scale; To the recovery of <hi>France</hi> there was yet a fairer opportunity given him by the revolt of <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Artois</hi> a Prince of the Blood Royal, and Brother in Law to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> the preſent <hi>French</hi> King, who upon diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent came over and diſcovered all the Secrets of the <hi>French</hi> Counſels to King
<hi>Edward,</hi> aſſuring him of the Affections of ſeveral of the <hi>French</hi> Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; And now the two Kings ſet up their Titles to the Kingdom of <hi>France; Edward</hi> was neareſt by Blood, but drew his Pedigree from a Female; <hi>Philip</hi> was farther off but deſcended of all Males, and becauſe the Law <hi>Salique,</hi> which excludes Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from Reigning in
<hi>France,</hi> was conceived as well to exclude all Deſcendants from Females,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40348:37"/>therefore was <hi>Philip</hi>'s Title accepted, the <hi>French</hi> obſtinately declaring, That they would never tye the Succeſſion of that Crown to a Diſtaff; To which King <hi>Edward</hi> replied, That he would then tye it to his Sword; With the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> took part the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror and the chief Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi> With the
<hi>French</hi> the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the two Dukes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Earl of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and divers Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> together with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Neighbour <hi>David Bruce</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> a weak but reſtleſs Enemy, againſt whom King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> had ſet up <hi>Edward Baliol</hi> as Competitor; and to whoſe aſſiſtance he ſends an Army toward <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and at <hi>Hallydown Hill</hi> near <hi>Berwick,</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> are utterly defeated, about Thirty Two Thouſand Souldiers being ſlain, with a great number of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry, After this King
<hi>Edward</hi> gained a Glorious Victory over the <hi>French</hi> at the Battel of
<hi>Creſſy,</hi> and another at <hi>Poictiers,</hi> wherein <hi>John</hi> King of
<hi>France</hi> was taken Priſoner; And <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> with an Army of Threeſcore Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men a ſecond time Invading <hi>England,</hi> his Army is routed and himſelf taken Priſoner.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> III. was of Stature indifferent tall, with ſparkling Eyes, and of a comely and manly countenance, no man was more mild when there was ſubmiſſion, nor none more fierce if oppoſed; He had a command over his Paſſions as well as People, being never ſo loving as to be fond, nor ſo angry as to be irreconcileable; But this muſt be underſtood of him when he was a man, for in his old age he became a Child again, and was Maſter of neither; He was Fortunate and Valiant, both which were heightened in the eſtimation of the World as reigning between two unfortunate Princes, his Father to whom he was Succeſſor, and his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<hi>Richard</hi> II. to whom he was Predeceſſor; His diſpoſition was ſo martial that his very Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40348:37"/>were Warllke, for he delighted in none more than in Juſts and Turnaments; and among the reſt in the fourth year of his Reign a ſolemn Turnament was held in
<hi>Cheapſide,</hi> between the great Croſs and the great Conduit, which laſted three days, where his Queen <hi>Philippa</hi> with many Ladies fell from a Stage erected for them to behold the Juſting, and though they were not hurt at all, yet the King threatned to puniſh the Carpenters for their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, till the Queen intreated pardon for them upon her Knees, as ſhe was always ready to do all good Offices of mercy to all People. To diſcover his Devotion one example may be ſufficient, for when neither Cardinals nor Counſellors could move him to make Peace with
<hi>France,</hi> a Tempeſt from Heaven did it; To which may be added, That he never won a great Battel but he preſently gave the Glory of it to God by publick Thanksgiving; He outlived the beſt Wife and the beſt Son that ever King had, and to ſay the truth, he out-lived the beſt of himſelf, leaving all Action, and bidding adieu to the World Ten Years before he went out of it, declining ſo faſt from the Fortieth year of his Government, that it may rather be ſaid his Son the Prince Reigned than he: and happy 'twas for him that when his own Underſtanding failed him he had ſo good a ſupporter. And the grief for the loſs of him, beſides the Fatigues of War, was thought to haſten his Death, together with the trouble for the loſs of the benefit of his Conqueſts in <hi>France,</hi> of all which he had at laſt little left but the Town of <hi>Callice.</hi> Being oppreſſed thus in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Mind, he was drawing his laſt breath when his Concubine <hi>Alice Pierce</hi> (who was ſo confident ſometime before, as to ſit in Courts of Juſtice, and overawe the Judges) packing away what ſhe could catch, even to the Rings of his Fingers, left him; and by her example others of his Attendants
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40348:38"/>ſeize on what they could meet with, and march away; yea all his Counſellors and Courtiers forſook him when he had moſt occaſion for them, leaving his Bed-Chamber quite empty. Which a poor Prieſt in his Palace obſerving, approached to his Bed-ſide, and finding him yet Breathing, called upon him to remember his Saviour, and to beg Mercy for his Offences, which none about him before would do; But now moved by the Voice of this Prieſt, he ſhews all ſigns of Contrition, and at his laſt Breath he pronounceth the Name of Jeſus. Thus died this Victorious King at his Manour of <hi>Sheen</hi> (now <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>) <hi>June</hi> 21. 1377. in the 64 year of his Age, having reigned above 50 years; His Body was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from <hi>Sheene</hi> by his four Sons (having had ſeven in all, and five Daughters) and the Nobility, and ſolemnly interred in <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey,</hi> where his Monument is to be ſeen, and likewiſe his Sword which it is ſaid he uſed in Battel being eight pound in weight, and ſeven foot in length.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Third Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> of the Blood Royal of <hi>England,,</hi> was
<hi>Edward</hi> commonly called the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> but why ſo named is uncertain, for to think it was becauſe of his dreadful actions (as <hi>Speed</hi> ſaith) has little probability, neither do the Hiſtorians of that Age ever give him that name, nor mention that he was ſo called; He was eldeſt Son to King <hi>Edward</hi> III. by the fair <hi>Philippa</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to
<hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Henault</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and born at <hi>Woodſtock, July</hi> 15. 1329. in the third year of his Father's Reign; He was afterwards created Prince of
<hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aquitain</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter;</hi> He was likewiſe Earl of <hi>Kent</hi> in the right of his Wife <hi>Joan</hi> Daughter of the Earl of that Name, and Brother by the Father's ſide to King <hi>Edward</hi> II. the moſt admired beauty of that Age. King <hi>Edward</hi> was very careful of his Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40348:38"/>providing him the moſt able Tutors to edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him both in Arts and Arms.</p>
            <p>When he was but fifteen years old, his Father paſſing over into <hi>France</hi> with a gallant Army, took his Son along with him, making him a Souldier before he was a Man, being willing to try his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and loth to omit any thing that might give reputation to that Battel wherein two Kingdoms were laid at Stake. In 1345. King <hi>Edward</hi> with a Fleet of about a Thouſand Sail, landed an Army of Two Thouſand Five Hundred Horſe and Thirty Thouſand Foot moſt of them Archers, in <hi>Normandy,</hi> making devaſtation of all before him even to the very Walls of
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King was not idle, having raiſed as brave an Army as <hi>France</hi> had ever ſeen, conſiſting in near an Hundred and Twenty Thouſand Fighting Men; K. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Army being loaden with the rich Spoils of the ruined Countrey, he was unwilling to retreat, neither indeed was he able being got into the Heart of the Enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, between the two fine Rivers of <hi>Scin</hi> and <hi>Soan,</hi> ſo that he began to inquire how he might find a paſſage out of theſe ſtraits, which the <hi>French</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notice of, looked upon as an intended flight, and King <hi>Edward</hi> was willing they ſhould nouriſh that opinton; The River <hi>Soan</hi> between <hi>Abbeville</hi> and the Sea was fordable when the Tyde was out, of which the <hi>French</hi> were aware, and therefore guarded the paſſage with a Thouſand Horſe, and Six Thouſand Foot commanded by <hi>Gundamar de Foy</hi> a Valiant <hi>Norman</hi> Lord. King <hi>Edward</hi> coming to this place plunges into the River, crying out, <hi>He that loves me will follow me;</hi> as reſolving either to paſs or dye; This ſo animated his Souldiers that the Paſſage was won, and <hi>Du Foy</hi> defeated by the undaunted courage of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was fought with; carrying back to King
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40348:39"/>
               <hi>Philip.</hi> Two Thouſand leſs than he brought beſide the terror of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Arms, the Souldiers reſolving to live and dye with ſuch a gallant So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign; King <hi>Edward</hi> was now near <hi>Creſcy</hi> in the Province of
<hi>Pontheiu</hi> between the Rivers <hi>Soam</hi> and <hi>Anthy</hi> (a place unqueſtionably belonging to him in right of his Mother) where he provided all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for a Battel; King
<hi>Philip</hi> inraged at the late defeat, and by his numerous Forces growing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of ſucceſs, marches furiouſly to fall upon them without any ſtop till they came within view of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colours.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> having implored the aid of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, full of hopes of obtaining Victory, without the leaſt diſturbance of mind, divided his Army into three Bodies; The Front was commanded by the young Lion of <hi>Wales</hi> our brave Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> aſſiſted with ſeveral of the moſt experienced Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals conſiſting of Eight Hundred Men at Arms, Two Thouſand Archers, and a Thouſand <hi>Welſhmen.</hi> The ſecond Battalian was commanded by the Earls of <hi>Northampton</hi> and <hi>Arundel</hi> with other Lords, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eight Hundred Men at Arms, and One Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Two Hundred Archers; The third and laſt being about Seven Hundred men at Arms, and Three Thouſand Archers, with the reſt of the Nobility, the King led himſelf, and being mounted upon a white Hobby he Rid through the ſeveral Ranks, reviving and incouraging his Souldiers with cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words to fight like Men for his Right and their Honour. He then ordered the Rear of the Army to be Barricado'd with Trees and Carriages, and likewiſe commanded the Troopers to diſmount and leave their Horſes behind them, ſo that all means of flight being taken away, they muſt now reſolve either to Conquer or Die.</p>
            <p>In King <hi>Philip's</hi> Army were the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the King of <hi>Majorca,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40348:39"/>Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Flanders, Nevers, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerre,</hi> with many other Dukes, Earls, Barons and Gentlemen Volunteers, both <hi>French, Dutch</hi> and
<hi>Germans;</hi> and juſt the Night before the Battel <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> joined him with a Thouſand Men at Arms; So that all things ſeemed to conſpire to elate the
<hi>French</hi> Pride and aſſure them of Victory; They divided their Army likewiſe into three Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talia's: The Van was led by the Duke of <hi>Alonſon</hi> the King's Brother, and the King of
<hi>Bohemia;</hi> The Reer by the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> And the main Battel the King Commanded himſelf; He was ſo impatient of delays that He would ſcarce ſtay to call a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of War to conſider how to manage the Fight; He likewiſe cauſed the Banner of <hi>Auriflamb</hi> to be erected, which was of red Silk and Hallowed by the Pope, of which the <hi>French</hi> had as high an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as if it had fallen from Heaven; The King of <hi>Bohemia</hi> hearing of the poſture of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, (contrary to the proud conceit of the <hi>French</hi>) ſaid, <hi>Here will the</hi> Engliſh <hi>end their Days or Conquer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A little before the Fight, happened a very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Tempeſt of Thunder and Rain, and a bright Rain-bow appeared in the Heavens; And ſoon after the Sun broke forth, ſhining full in the Faces of the <hi>French</hi> and on the Back of the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and at the ſame time great numbers of Ravens and other Birds of Prey flew over the <hi>French</hi> Army; All which accidents were judged ominous, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaging miſchief to the Enemy; The ſignal of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel being given by King <hi>Philip,</hi> it was entertained by a ſhout from his Army, the Drums beat, the Trumpets ſounded, Banners flew in the Air; Glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Swords were ſeen threatning Death and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and all the horrors of War appeared in their moſt diſmal Colours. The ruine of the <hi>French</hi> began at the <hi>Genoeſes,</hi> who being all Croſs-Bow Men were ordered to open a way for the <hi>French</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:40348:40"/>Horſe, but it happened that their Bow-ſtrings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wet by the late great Shower, and their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies weary with a long March, after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had received the firſt Volley of their Arrows with their Targets, their Ranks were opened in many places by the fall of their ſlain Fellows, who were kill'd by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bowmen, and at length moſt outragiouſly ſcattered and trampled under foot by the Duke of <hi>Alanſon</hi> (by Command of the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) who bringing up the Horſe in a full Career, cried out; <hi>On, on, let us make our way upon the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of theſe Genoeſes, who do but hinder us;</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly Rides through the midſt of them, followed by the Dukes of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and
<hi>Savoy,</hi> never ſtaying till they came to that Body of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Gallant Prince of <hi>Wales;</hi> Theſe <hi>French</hi> Gallants half out of breath with their Poſt haſte, and terribly diſordered by the perpetual Storms of our Whiſtling Arrows, came now to handy ſtrokes with the Princes Squadron with Battle Axes, Swords and Lances; The Fight was very bloody while each earneſtly contended for Victory. The old King of
<hi>Bohemia</hi> reſolving to dye honourably, thruſt himſelf into the firſt Ranks of his own Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and furiouſly charging the <hi>Engliſh</hi> he was ſlain with Sword in hand, the Troop of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Followers with their ſlaughtered Bodies cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him even in Death, and his fate was ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the fall of the <hi>Bohemian</hi> Standard.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> in Perſon, with a ſtrong Party, haſtened to the relief of his Brother and Friends who were alſo much diſtreſt by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, and great numbers ſlain, though the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was in danger in the encounter, had not his Souldiers ruſht in couragiouſly among their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies for the preſervation of their worthy Prince.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> ſtood all this while upon <hi>Windmill-Hill</hi> (with his Helmet on, which he never pull'd
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40348:40"/>off till the Fight was ended) judiciouſly ſurveying the whole Field of Battel to obſerve the ſucceſs, being ready to bring down his Party which lay hovering like a Black Cloud, where neceſſity ſhould require. In the mean time the brave Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> was contending with the whole power of <hi>France,</hi> whereupon ſome of his Generals ſeeing the great inequality, and doubting the worſt, they ſent to the King, requeſting his aſſiſtance; The King asked the Meſſenger, whether his Son were ſlain or hurt; who replied, <hi>No, he was ſafe, but like to be over powered by the multitude of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi>
               <q>Well then, ſaid the King, go back to them that ſent you, and tell them that ſo long as my Son is alive, they ſend no more to me whatever happen, for I deſign that the honour of this day ſhallbe his if God permit him to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, and am reſolved that he ſhall either win the Spurs or loſe his life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This reſolution of the King's though it brought no aſſiſtance, yet ſeemed to inſpire new Life and Spirits into the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſo that they fought like <hi>Lions;</hi> On the otherſide King <hi>Philip</hi> whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom lay at Stake, performed the Duty of a good General, and a gallant Souldier, fighting ſo long in his own Perſon, till his Horſe was killed under him, himſelf twice diſmounted, and wounded both in the Neck and Thigh, and in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trodden to death; had not the Earl of <hi>Beaumont</hi> reſcued and remounted him, and the <hi>French</hi> out of their Loyalty to ſave him (almoſt againſt his Will) conveyed him out of the Field, who ſeemed rather deſirous to end his days in ſuch noble Company. His departure was quickly known to both Armies, and as ſuddenly put an end to this bloody Carnage, wherein hitherto none had quarter, but were all put to the Sword; The
<hi>French</hi> King himſelf with a ſmall Company fled to <hi>Bray</hi> in the Night, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40348:41"/>the Walls the Guard demanded who was there, He replied, <hi>The Fortune of France;</hi> By his Voice he was Known, and thereupon received into the Town with the Tears and lamentations of his People; The reſt of his Army ſtrove to ſave themſelves by flight, whom the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not purſue, but ſtood ſtill upon their Guard, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the true Rules of Martial Diſcipline, being unwilling to hazard ſo glorious a Victory by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in the Night, knowing there were ſo many of the Enemy eſcaped as might yet overwhelm their tired Army with multitude.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edward</hi> ſeeing the Field clear of the <hi>French,</hi> came down from the Hill with his Troops entire toward his Victorious Son, whom moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately imbracing and kiſſing he ſaid,
<q>Fair Son, God ſend you good perſeverance to ſuch proſperous beginnings, you have acquitted your ſelf right Nobly, and are well worthy to have a Kingdom intruſted to your Government for your Valour;</q> To which the moſt Noble and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Prince replied, with ſilence, humbly falling on his Knees at the Feet of his Triumphant Father; After this Victory King <hi>Edward</hi> marched with his Army through <hi>France,</hi> and Beſieged
<hi>Calice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In 1355. King <hi>Edward</hi> was informed that <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being dead, King <hi>John</hi> his Son and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor had given the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitain</hi> to
<hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Dauphin</hi> his Eldeſt Son, whereupon the King being much incenſed, conferr'd the ſame upon his own Son the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> commanding him to defend his Right therein with his Sword againſt his Adverſaries; He was likewiſe appointed by Parliament to go into <hi>Gaſcoin</hi> with a thouſand men at Arms, Two Thouſand Archers, and a great number of <hi>Welſhmen</hi> who accompanied their Prince; and ſoon after with Three Hundred Sail of Ships, attended by many of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40348:41"/>in <hi>France,</hi> and with his Victorious Arms March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into
<hi>Aquitain,</hi> recovering a great number of Cities and Towns, and releaſing a multitude of Priſoners; He then entred <hi>Guienne,</hi> paſſing over <hi>Languedock</hi> to
<hi>Tholouſe, Narbone</hi> and <hi>Bruges</hi> without oppoſition, and loaden with Plunder return'd to <hi>Bourdeux;</hi> Afterward he made a ſecond Courſe through <hi>Perigort</hi> and
<hi>Limoſin</hi> into the Bowels of <hi>France,</hi> even to the very Gates of <hi>Bruges</hi> in
<hi>Berry,</hi> the terror of his name preparing his way, and then wheeled about deſigning to return by <hi>Remorantine</hi> in <hi>Blaſois,</hi> which Town he took, and ſo through the Countrey of <hi>Tourain, Poictou</hi> and <hi>Xantoign</hi> to his Chief City of
<hi>Bourdeux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But King <hi>John</hi> having raiſed a very Potent Army followed him in the Rear, and about the City of <hi>Poictiers</hi> he overtook our Invincible Prince, where the Armies approached each other, the <hi>French</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſix to one; Two Cardinals ſent from Pope <hi>Clement</hi> (as before the former Battel) mediated to take up the Quarrel, but the
<hi>French</hi> King ſuppoſing he had his Enemy now at his mercy would hear of no conditions, but that the Prince ſhould deliver him four Hoſtages, and as Vanquiſhed render up himſelf and his Army to his diſcretion; The Prince was content to reſtore to him all the places he had taken, but without prejudice to his Honour, wherein he ſaid, he ſtood accountable to his Father and his Country. But King <hi>John</hi> would not abate any thing of his firſt demands, as judging himſelf ſecure of Victory, and thereupon was ready to attack the Prince, who in this exigency politickly got the advantage of the ground, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the benefit of certain Vines, Shrubs and Buſhes upon that part where he was like to be aſſaulted, whereby to imbaraſs and diſturb the <hi>French</hi> Horſe whom he ſaw ready to fall furiouſly upon him; The ſucceſs anſwered his expectation,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40348:42"/>for the Enemies Cavalry in their full Career were ſo intangled and incumbered among their Vines that the Prince's Archers galled and annoyed them at pleaſure; For the
<hi>French</hi> King to give the Honour of the day to his Horſe, made uſe of them only, without the aid of his Infantry; And they being thus diſordered, the whole Army was thereby ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly defeated; Here, if ever, the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and his <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> gave full proof of their undaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Courage and Valour, never giving over till they had wholly routed all the three
<hi>French</hi> Battalions, the leaſt of which exceeded the number of the Prince's Forces. King
<hi>John</hi> himſelf Fighting va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly, and <hi>Philip</hi> his youngeſt Son (who by his undaunted Proweſs ſo defended his diſtreſſed Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he gained the Sirname of
<hi>Hardy</hi>) were both taken Priſoners. The moſt remarkable of the Prince's Commanders for Courage and Conduct were the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Suffolk, Salisbury, Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and
<hi>Stafford;</hi> The Lords <hi>Chandois, Cobham, Spencer, Berkley, Baſſet,</hi> &amp;c. and particularly <hi>James</hi> Lord <hi>Audley</hi> ſignaliz'd himſelf, receiving many wounds, and was rewarded by the Noble Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> with the gift of Five Hundred Marks Land a year in <hi>England,</hi> which he inſtantly divided among his four Eſquires, who had ſtood by him in all the fury and brunt of this bloody Battel; Whereupon the Prince asked him if he did not accept of his gift; He anſwered, <hi>That theſe men had deſerved it as well as himſelf, and needed it more;</hi> With which reply the Prince was ſo well pleaſed, that he gave him Five Hundred Marks a Year more. A rare example, where deſert in the Subject and reward in the Prince ſtrove to exceed each other. He vowed to be foremoſt in the Fight and made good his word.</p>
            <p>It was the misfortune or rather glory of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility in theſe diſaſtrous times, that the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40348:42"/>loſs commonly fell very heavy upon them, for in this fatal overthrow the
<hi>French</hi> confeſs that Fifty Two Lords, and about One Thouſand Seven Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Knights, Eſquires, and Gentlemen were ſlain; The chief were, the Duke of <hi>Athens,</hi> the High Conſtable, Great Marſhal, and High Chamberlain of <hi>France,</hi> the Biſhop of

So wonderfully did the great God of Battels fight for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in thoſe days. There eſcaped from this bloody fight Three of the <hi>French</hi> King's Sons, (for he brought them all into the Field) <hi>Charles</hi> the Dauphin, <hi>Lewis</hi> Duke of
<hi>Anjou,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> Duke of <hi>Barry.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Priſoners taken were <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, the Archbiſhop of
<hi>Sens,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Ponthieu, Eu, Longuevil, Vendoſme, Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kervile, Salbruch, Naſſaw, Dampmartin, La Roch, Vaudemont, Eſtampes,</hi> &amp;c. With many other Lords and Two Thouſand Knights, Eſquires and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that bore Coats of Arms.</p>
            <p>After the Battel a Contention aroſe who was the Man that took King <hi>John</hi> Priſoner. At length the King himſelf decided the Controverſie by declaring that one Sir <hi>Dennis Morbeck</hi> of St. <hi>Omers</hi> had made him Priſoner. For which ſervice the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> rewarded him with a Thouſand Marks, This great Battel was fought <hi>Sept.</hi>

            <p>After the Battel, Prince <hi>Edward</hi> led King <hi>John</hi> and the Captive Nobles Priſoners to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> the Archiepiſcopal See, and chief City of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in
<hi>France,</hi> where he retained them till the Spring following: But ſent preſent News of this Victory to his Father, who thereupon ordered a <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to be celebrated all over
<hi>England</hi> for eight days together.</p>
            <p>The Prince, having refreſhed his Men, the <hi>May</hi> following ſet ſail for
<hi>England,</hi> with his Priſoners, and ſafely arrived at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and was with great joy and acclamations received every where. At his coming to <hi>London</hi> where at that time, a magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Citizen, <hi>Henry Picard</hi> (he who afterwards at one time ſo Nobly Feaſted the four King's of <hi>England, France, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi>) was Lord Major, he received him with all imaginable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. And the multitude of People, that came to ſee the Victorious Prince, with the King of <hi>France,</hi> his Son <hi>Philip,</hi> and the other Priſoners, was ſo great, that they could hardly get to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> between three a Clock in the Morning, and twelve at Noon: Great <hi>Edward,</hi> ſaving that he forgat not the Majeſty of a Conqueror, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>f a King of
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> omitted no kind of civility towards the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. King <hi>John,</hi> and his Son, were lodged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Guard at the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was then a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Palace belonging to <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter;</hi> and the other Priſoners in other places.</p>
            <p>Some time after Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> by diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, married the Counteſs of
<hi>Kent,</hi> Daughter to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:40348:45"/>
               <hi>Edmund,</hi> Brother to King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, and his Father inveſted him with the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitain:</hi> So that he was now Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> Duke of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> Duke of <hi>Cornwal,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and
<hi>Kent.</hi> And not long after, he with his Beloved Wife, paſſed over into <hi>France,</hi> and kept his Court at <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was now grown famous over all the Chriſtian World, and the man to whom all wronged Princes ſeemed to Appeal, and to fly for relief. For which end there came at this time to his Court <hi>James,</hi> King of <hi>Majorca,</hi> and <hi>Richard,</hi> King of
<hi>Navarr,</hi> juſt when his Lady brought him a Son, for whom theſe two Kings undertook at his Baptiſm, giving him the Name of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Soldiers, moſt of whoſe Captains were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> either by Birth, or Obedience, wanting employment, becauſe the Wars of <hi>Britain</hi> were quieted for the Preſent, ranged tumultuouſly up and down <hi>France:</hi> But about this time Sir <hi>Bertram de Glequin</hi> (having paid his Ranſom) found em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for them, drawing the greateſt part of that Military Peſtilence into another Coaſt. For by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Peter</hi> King of
<hi>Arragon,</hi> and the Power of <hi>Glequin,</hi> with his floating Bands, called <hi>The Companions,</hi> or <hi>Adventurers, Peter</hi> King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon</hi> (a cruel Tyrant) was driven out of his Kingdom, his Baſtard Brother <hi>Henry</hi> being cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen in his room, and Crowned King of <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Burgos.</hi> This <hi>Peter</hi> was Son to
<hi>Alphonſus</hi> the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth King of <hi>Caſtile,</hi> and had to Wife a <hi>French</hi> Lady called <hi>Blanch,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Peter</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was Father alſo of <hi>Joan,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King's Wife. His Tyrannical cruelties were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſo foul, that the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Stories, ſcarce allow <hi>Nero</hi> or
<hi>Caligula</hi> to go beyond him: For which, by his Subjects he was depoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:40348:46"/>
               <hi>Peter</hi> thus driven out of his Kingdom, by the aid of the
<hi>French,</hi> applied himſelf to Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> craving his aſſiſtance for his reſtoration, making many and large Promiſes to him upon the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof. The Prince out of Charity to ſuccour a diſtreſſed Prince, and out of Policy to imploy his Souldiers, having got leave of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, marched with a gallant Army of thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, upon confidence of good pay for his men, and other benefits when <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould be re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in his Throne; He made his way through the famous ſtraits of
<hi>Rouncevallux</hi> in <hi>Navarre,</hi> by permiſſion of that King, who yet ſuffered himſelf to be carried Priſoner, into <hi>Caſtile,</hi> that he might not ſeem to croſs the <hi>French</hi> King's deſigns, who favoured <hi>Henry</hi> the Uſurper. Our Prince had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n his Company, beſides moſt of all the principal Captain of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> two King's, <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Caſtile</hi> whoſe the quarrel was, and the King of <hi>Majorca;</hi> As alſo <hi>John</hi> Duke of
<hi>Lancaſter,</hi> who after <hi>Don Pedro</hi>'s death, having married his eldeſt daughter, wrote himſelf King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> and <hi>Leon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, King <hi>Henry</hi> for the defence of his new Kingdom, had raiſed a very great Army, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting partly of <hi>French,</hi> under <hi>Glequin</hi> their famous Captains, and of <hi>Caſtilians</hi> and others, both Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Saracens to the number of about an hundred thouſand. And upon the Borders of <hi>Caſtile</hi> it came to a bloody battel, wherein the valaint Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> obtained a very great victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having ſlain many thouſands of his enemies. <hi>Henry</hi> himſelf fighting valiantly, was wounded in the Groin, but yet eſcaped. There were taken Priſoners, the Earl of <hi>Dene, Bertram de Glequin</hi> (who yet ſhortly after, by paying a great Ranſom was ſet at liberty.) The Marſhal
<hi>Dandrehen,</hi> and many others. Neither was this Victory leſs worth
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40348:46"/>to <hi>Peter</hi> than a Kingdom: For our moſt Noble Prince left him not, till at <hi>Burgos</hi> he had ſet him upon his Throne again.</p>
            <p>But this unworthy King's falſhood and ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude were odious and monſtrous. For the Prince notwithſtanding this great ſucceſs was enforced to return to <hi>Burdeaux</hi> without money to pay his Army, which cauſed great miſchiefs to himſelf, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominions beyond the Seas, as if God had been diſpleaſed with his ſuccouring ſuch a Tyrant. The Prince himſelf, though he returned with Victory, yet he brought back with him ſuch a crazineſs, and indiſpoſition of Body, that he was never throughly well after. And no marvel, conſidering the Country, the Seaſon, and the action it ſelf, and it may be more wondred at, that his Souldiers came home ſo well, then that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſo ill: Being come home, diſcontent of Mind was added to his indiſpoſition of Body. For not having Money to pay his Soldiers, he was forced to wink at their preying upon the Country, for which the Country, to ſtop whoſe murmuring, his Chancellor the Biſhop of <hi>Rhodes</hi> deviſed a new Impoſition of levying a <hi>Frank</hi> for every Chimney, to continue for five years to pay the Prince's debts. But this Impoſition (though granted in Parliament) made their murmurs encreaſe; For though ſome part of his Dominions, as the <hi>Poictorians,</hi> the <hi>Xan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toigns,</hi> and the
<hi>Limoſins,</hi> ſeemed to conſent to it, yet the Counts of <hi>Armigniac</hi> and
<hi>Cominges,</hi> the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Carmain,</hi> and divers others, ſo much diſtaſted it, that they complained thereof to the King of <hi>France,</hi> as unto their Supreme Lord: Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that the Prince was to anſwer before King <hi>Charles,</hi> as before his Superior Lord, of whom (they ſaid) he held by homage and fealty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as King <hi>Edward</hi> and his Heirs by the Treaty at <hi>Bretagny</hi> were abſolutely freed from all manner of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40348:47"/>Service for any of their Dominions in <hi>France;</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi> openly entertained this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and hoping to regain by ſurprize and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, what the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> had won by dint of Sword, and true Manhood, he ſummoned the Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> to anſwer ſuch Complaints as his ſubjects made againſt him.</p>
            <p>Our valiant Prince returned anſwer,
<q>That if he muſt needs appear, he would bring threeſcore thouſand men in Arms to appear with him.</q> And now began the Peace between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> to be unſetled and wavering. For while King <hi>Edward</hi> rejoyced in the excellent Vertues and Actions of his Son and People, <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, warned by ſo many calamities as his Dominions had ſuſtained by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> War: and earneſtly coveting to recover the Honour of his Nation, betook himſelf to ſecret practices. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver adventuring his own Perſon in the Field, but executing all by his Deputies and Lieutenants, eſpecially by the valour and ſervice of <hi>Bertram de Glequin,</hi> Conſtable of <hi>France,</hi> who from a low eſtate was raiſed to this height for his prudent and magnanimous Conduct in War. And our truly Noble King (without ſuſpicion of craft) repoſing himſelf upon the Rules of Vertue and Magnanimity, did not reap the ſtable effects of ſo great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant victories, nor of the Peace ſo Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly made, that (in the World's opinion) it could not be broken, without the manifeſt violation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ſide, of all Bonds both divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> by Letters adviſed his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not to truſt to any fair words, or overtures of further Amity made by the <hi>French,</hi> becauſe (as he ſaid) they entertained Practices underhand in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place againſt him. But his counſel was not heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, becauſe he was judged to write out of a
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40348:47"/>reſtleſs humour, delighting in War, though the event ſhewed that his words were true. For now King <hi>Charles,</hi> having by quick payments, and other means got home all the Hoſtages which had been delivered for performance of the Articles of Peace, ſet all his wits on work to abuſe the King of <hi>England</hi>'s credulity. He courted him with lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Letters and Preſents, and in the mean time ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the County of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> (our King's undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inheritance) before King <hi>Edward</hi> heard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Who hereupon calls a Parliament, declares the breach, craves aid, and hath it granted. And then again claims the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and ſent over his Son <hi>John,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and
<hi>Humfrey de Bohun,</hi> Earl of <hi>Hereford,</hi> with a great Army to <hi>Calice</hi> to invade <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the States and Towns made over to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the Treaty of
<hi>Bretigni,</hi> which had revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>French,</hi> was the City of <hi>Limoſin:</hi> Thither did the Prince march, and ſat down with his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before it: And not long after came unto him out of <hi>England,</hi> his two Brethren the Duke of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter,</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> with a freſh ſupply of Valiant Captains, and Souldiers. The City held out to the utmoſt, and was at laſt taken by ſtorm, where no mercy was ſhewed by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged Soldiers, but Sword and Fire laid all deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. After this Service, the Prince's health fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him more and more, he left his Brethren in <hi>Aquitain</hi> to proſecute the Wars, and himſelf tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ship, came over to his Father in <hi>England,</hi> his eldeſt Son <hi>[Edward]</hi> being dead a little before at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and brought over with him his Wife and his other Son
<hi>Richard.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince having left <hi>France,</hi> his Dominions were either taken or fell away faſter than they were gotten, <hi>Gueſchlin</hi> entred <hi>Poictou,</hi> took <hi>Montmorillon, Chauvigny, Luſſack</hi> and <hi>Moncontour.</hi> Soon after fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40348:48"/>the Country of <hi>Aulnis,</hi> of <hi>Xantoyn,</hi> and the reſt of
<hi>Poictou:</hi> Then St. <hi>Maxent, Neel, Aulnay: Benaon, Marant, Surgers, Fontency,</hi> and at laſt they came to <hi>Thouras,</hi> where the moſt part of the Lords of <hi>Poictou,</hi> that held with the Prince, were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. At this time the King, Prince <hi>Edward,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and all the Great Lords of <hi>England</hi> ſet forward for their relief: But being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven back by a Tempeſt, and ſuccour not coming, <hi>Thouras</hi> was yielded upon compoſition. In fine, all <hi>Poictou</hi> was loſt, and then <hi>Aquitain,</hi> all, but only <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> and <hi>Bayon.</hi> And not long after Prince <hi>Edward</hi> died, and with him the Fortune of <hi>England.</hi> He was a Prince ſo full of Virtues as were ſcarce to be matcht by others. He died at <hi>Canterbury</hi> upon <hi>Trinity Sunday, June</hi>
8. in the forty ſixth year of his Age, and the forty ninth of his Father's Reign: and was buried in <hi>Chriſt's-Church</hi> there, 1376.</p>
            <p>Among all the Gallant men of that Age this our Prince was ſo worthily the firſt, He had a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Monument erected for him, upon which this <hi>Epitaph</hi> was engraven in Braſs, in

               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:40348:49"/>I ſhall only add this ſhort Remark, That the Captivity of two Kings at the ſame time, namely <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>David Bruce</hi> King of

The <hi>Scots</hi> King could not gain his Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in twice the time, being the leſs able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem himſelf, for that he was upon the matter half a King, the other half being in the poſſeſſion of
<hi>Edward Baliol,</hi> but at length he was ranſomed for ten thouſand Marks, and reſtored to his Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The forth Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Royal Line was
<hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> ſo called from the place of his Birth. The Black Prince his renowned Father, whoſe Wiſdom doubtleſs was no way ſhort of his Courage, knowing how apt they who ſtand near the Throne are to ſtep into it, was ſo intent to prevent any diſorder of that kind that might be feared from the well known am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of his aſpiring Brothers, the Eldeſt of whom <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> (afterward King
<hi>Henry</hi> IV.) having the Title of King of <hi>Caſtile</hi> in the Right of his Wife, but without any Kingdom, might reaſonably be ſuſpected to affect one ſo much
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40348:49"/>the more his own Right, and to take advantage of his Nephew <hi>Richard</hi>'s weakneſs. He therefore made it his dying requeſt to his declining Father, to inaugurate his Son whilſt he was yet alive, that by being committed to the Parliaments care, he might have publick ſecurity againſt all private ſupplantations, and without further diſpute enjoy all thoſe Prerogatives which either his own Right, or his Father's Merit intituled him to. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he was ſet upon the Throne at Eleven years of Age, and in the life time of his Grandfather
<hi>Edward</hi> III. began to Reign by the name of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> II. with this happineſs, that at the ſame time he took upon him to Govern them, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament entred into Conſultation about the Perſons fitteſt to Govern him; And becauſe the ſafety of the King as well as of the Kingdom, conſiſted in the multitude of Counſellors, they deſigned to add to his Uncle the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> (who was ambitious of being Protector) the two other Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Edmund</hi> Earl of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Woodſtock</hi> Duke of
<hi>Gloceſter,</hi> with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined ſeveral Spiritual and Temporal Lords of known Wiſdom and Integrity. This ſo offended the Duke, as ſeeming a reflection on his Ambition not to be truſted ſolely, that he refuſed the charge, and retiring into the Country, ſo play'd the King at his own Houſe, that a poor well meaning Fryar thought himſelf obliged in point of Allegiance to accuſe him of an Intention to Uſurp the Crown, and conſequently to deſtroy the King. Neither wanted he matter enough, 'tis thought, to make out that charge, but his Innocence being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matcht by Power, and having none to ſecond his accuſation, the Crime w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40348:50"/>to his Privy Members, hung him up on a Pin, and with the weight of a Stone laid upon his Belly, burſt his back, and ſo all further proof deceaſed with him.</p>
            <p>This being known among the People, and no puniſhment inflicted upon the Murtherers, dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated very much from the young King's Juſtice and Honour among his Subjects, who not being able to diſtinguiſh betwixt the want of Skill, and want of Power to puniſh, began thenceforth to Worſhip the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> as the <hi>Indians</hi> do the Devil for fear. And as the King's Father Prince <hi>Edward</hi> never recovered the health which he loſt in the laſt expedition into <hi>Spain,</hi> ſo his Son never recovered this and other diſadvantages, put upon him by his ambitious Uncle, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly that the very firſt day he took his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's Seat in Parliament as Heir Apparent to the Crown, he taught him to demand a Subſidy, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to alienate the Peoples Affections from him, who were before ſufficiently diſguſted with the heavy Taxes they had already paid: And likewiſe his ommitting no occaſion of propagating Tumults and Factions, whereby he at length deprived his Nephew firſt of his Crown, and then of his Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> II. was the comelieſt Perſon of all the Kings ſince the Conqueſt, being Tall, well Limb'd and Strong, and of ſo amiable a Countenance, that he might well be the Son of ſuch a beautiful Mother. As to his Temper of Mind, it proceeded more from his Education than his natural Humour, for he ſeemed to have many good Inclinations, which might have grown into Habits, had they not been perverted by corrupted Flatterers in his Youth. He was of a credulous diſpoſition, apt to believe, and therefore eaſie to be abuſed, and it was his great weakneſs that he could not diſtinguiſh
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:40348:50"/>between a Paraſite and and a Friend. He ſeemed to partake both of a
<hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nature, being violent at the firſt apprehenſion of a thing, and calm upon deliberation. He never ſhewed himſelf ſo worthy of the Government, as when he was De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as unworthy to Govern. For it appeared that the Royal Dignity was not ſo pleaſing to him, as a quiet retired Life, which if he might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, he would never have complained, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune had done him wrong. He lived thirty three years, and reigned twenty and two months, and was Murdered at <hi>Pomfreh</hi> Caſtle in the place of his Birth.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> the Son and Succeſſor of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was the Fifth Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the Royal Blood of <hi>England.</hi> He was bred a Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in Queens College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> and from thence being called to Court, the Lord
<hi>Piercy</hi> Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> was made his Governour. But coming afterward to be at his own diſpoſing, whether be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by nature valorous, and yet not well ſtaid by time and experience, or whether incited by ill Companions, and imboldened by the opinion of his own Greatneſs, he ran into many Courſes ſo unworthy of a Prince, that it was much doubted what he might prove if he ſhould come to be King. For it is recorded that he with ſome other young Lords and Gentlemen, lay in wait in diſguiſe for the Receivers of his Father's Revenue, whom they robbed of their Money to maintain their riotous Living, though ſometimes they miſſed their Prize, and were ſoundly beaten in proſecuting ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, and when upon his return to Court he had heard the Receivers complain of their great loſſes, he would give them Money to make them part of amends, but rewarded thoſe beſt that had made the ſtouteſt defence, and from whom he had received the moſt blows. It happened that one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:40348:51"/>of his Companions was arraigned at the King's Bench Bar in
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall for Felony, of which the Prince being informed, he by the advice of the reſt, came in a great rage to the Bar, and attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take away the Priſoner by force, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that his Fetters ſhould be taken off, and he ſet at Liberty. All preſent were much amazed, but Sir <hi>William Gaſcoign</hi> then Lord Chief Juſtice mildly deſired him to forbear, and ſuffer the Felon to be Tryed by the Laws of the Land, and that he might afterward get his Pardon of his Father, if there were occaſion. The Prince grew more inflamed at theſe words, and endeavoured to take him away himſelf. But the Judge charging him upon his Allegiance to withdraw out of the Court, the Prince furiouſly ſtept up to him, and ſtruck him over the Face: Whereat the Judge not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed, roſe up and told him,
<q>That the affront he had offered, was not done to him, but to the King his Father, whom he did there repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And therefore I charge you, ſaith he, to deſiſt from proceeding any further in your Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs deſigns, and I commit you to the King's Bench, there to remain during your Father's pleaſure, for the abuſe you have committed, and the ill example you have given to thoſe that may hereafter be your own Subjects.</q> It was wonderful to ſee how calm the Prince was in his own cauſe, who had been ſo violent in that of his Companion, for laying aſide his Dagger which he had in his hand, and with which the People feared he would have killed the Judg, he quietly ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Order, and went to the King's Bench. At which his Attendants being in a great fury, ran inſtantly with mighty complaints to the King giving him an account of the whole matter. King <hi>Henry</hi> appeared at firſt a little ſurprized, but recollecting himſelf, he ſeemed raviſhed with joy, and holding
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40348:51"/>up his hands to Heaven, cry'd out, <hi>O merciful God, how much am I bound to thy Infinite goodneſs, that thou haſt given me a Judge, who is of ſuch Courage as not to be afraid to adminiſter Juſtice, and a Son of ſuch humility that he will ſubmit thereunto.</hi> However for theſe and ſome other Pranks he removed him from being Preſident of the Council, and put his youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Brother Lord <hi>John</hi> in his place. This made the Prince ſo ſenſible of his Father's anger, which ſome of his Enemies endeavoured to heighten, that he thought it neceſſary to uſe all means to recover his good opinion, which he endeavoured to do by a way as ſtrange as that by which he loſt it. Of which I ſhall give an account in the words of the Larl of <hi>Ormond,</hi> who was an Eye and Ear witneſs of the ſame.</p>
            <p>During the ſickneſs of the King, faith he, ſome ill diſpoſed people endeavoured to raiſe diſſention between him and his Son, reproaching the Prince both with the Frolicks of his Youth, and for the great concourſe of People that continually attended his Court far exceeding thoſe of his Father, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they inſinuated, that he deſigned to uſurp the Crown during his Life, which raiſed much jealouſie in the King's Mind, and greatly alienated his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections from him. The Prince had notice thereof by ſome of his Friends in Court. Whereupon he attired himſelf in a Garment of blew Sattin, wrought all with Oylet holes of black Silk, at every hole a Needle hanging by which it was ſowed, and about his Arm he wore a Hound's Collar ſtudded with S S. of Gold. Thus ſtrangely apparrell'd, with a large Retinue of Young Noblemen, he came to his Father at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and his Attendants ſtaying in the Hall by his Order to prevent ſuſpicion, he himſelf with the King's Officers went to wait upon his Father. Being admitted into the Preſence, after due obeyſance, the Prince deſired that he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40348:52"/>might have Audience of his Majeſty in the Privy Chamber. Upon which the King cauſed himſelf to be carried thither in a Chair, where in the Preſence of only three or four of his Privy-Council, he demanded of the Prince the Cauſe of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wonted Habit and Coming.</p>
            <p>The Prince kneeling, replied,
<q>Moſt honoured Lord and Father, I am come to throw my ſelf at your Majeſtie's Feet, as your moſt Loyal Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Obedient Son, to whom nothing is more afflicting than that your Majeſty ſhould enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the leaſt jealouſie of my deſigning any thing againſt your Royal Dignity, or to imagine me ſo horridly undutiful and ingrateful to a Father who hath always ſhewed ſuch tender love and affection to me, as your Highneſs hath always done, ſo that I ſhould deſerve a thouſand deaths, if I durſt imagine the leaſt harm or damage againſt your Sacred Perſon. And if it be my bounden duty, to hazard my life in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence againſt any, even the greateſt Traytor whatſoever, then much more ought I to Sacrifice my ſelf to free your Grace from the fear of any peril or danger from me, and upon that account, I have this day by confeſſing my Sins, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament prepared my ſelf for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther World. Therefore, moſt Honoured Father, I beſeech you for God's ſake to put an end to my life, now lying at your Feet, with this Dagger, (delivering his Dagger to the K.) for I had rather be out of the World, than continue a day longer in it, to give any diſturbance to your mind. And dear Father, in the doing hereof I freely forgive you, as I ſhall do the ſame before God at the Day of Judgment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King was ſo moved at theſe words, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> throwing the Dagger away, he fell upon his Neck and imbracing him, ſaid,
<q>My dear and truly be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:40348:52"/>loved Son, I muſt confeſs I had entertained ſome ſuſpicions, but I now find they were altogether cauſleſs on your part, and ſince I am now ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your fidelity and obedience, I do aſſure you upon my honour, I will never hereafter har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour any ill opinion of you, whatſoever may be ſuggeſted againſt you.</q> And hereupon he was fully reſtored to the King's former Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>The King's weakneſs of Body increaſing daily, he oft-times took occaſion to give ſome uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his Son, for the future Governing of his Kingdom, to this effect.
<q>Dear Son, I am much concerned for fear that after my deceaſe ſome difference may ariſe betwixt you and your Brother <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> whereby great miſchiefs may happen to the Kingdom, you being both of great Spirits, and he of an Uſurping Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which I am ſure you will never endure. And as often as I think of it, I heartily repent me that ever I charged my ſelf with the troubles of a Crown. The Prince replied, Gracious Soveraign and Father, I pray God continue long your Life and Reign to Govern us both, but if it pleaſe the Almighty that I ſhall ſucceed you in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, I ſhall honour and love my Brethren above all others, ſo long as they be true and faithful to me their Soveraign Lord. But if any of them ſhall conſpire or rebel againſt me, I do aſſure you, I ſhall as ſoon execute juſtice on them as upon the meaneſt and moſt inconſiderable Perſon in the Nation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The King was extreamly pleaſed with this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and then proceeded.
<q>My well beloved Son, Thou haſt much eaſed my troubled Mind, and I charge thee to do as thou haſt ſaid, To adminiſter Juſtice impartially, but to be always ready, and ſpeedy in relieving the Oppreſſed. And let not
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:40348:53"/>Flatterers, whoſe hands are full of Bribes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thy Mind therefrom. Delay not to do Juſtice to day if thou be able, leſt God ſhould execute Juſtice upon thee, and deprive thee of thine authority. Remember that the happineſs of thy Soul, thy Body, and thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom depends thereupon. Yet in ſome Caſes let Juſtice be tempered with Mercy, leſt thou be accounted a Tyrant, but be ſure that thou take great care to redreſs the Grievances of thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and ſeverely puniſh thoſe that wrong them. Hereby ſhalt thou gain the
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi>'s Hearts, and reign proſperouſly: for ſo long as they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy their Liberties and Eſtates, thou may'ſt be ſure of their Loyalty and Obedience, but if thou ſtrive to ſlave or impoveriſh them, they will certainly rebel againſt thee, for ſuch is their nature that they will rather chuſe to dye Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than to live Slaves and Beggars. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou Govern thein with a mixture of love and fear, thou wilt be King over the moſt Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and Fruitful Countrey, and the moſt Lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Faithful, and Valiant People in the World, whereby thou wilt be a terror to all thine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. My Son, when it ſhall pleaſe God to take me out of the World, which is the Common Lot of all men, I muſt leave my Crown and Kingdom to thee, and I would earneſtly adviſe thee, that of all things thou wilt avoid Pride, neither be thou bewitcht with worldly honour, ſo as to be exalted in thine own imagination, but always remember that the higher thy Dignity is, ſo much greater is the burden that lyes upon thee for the ſecurity of thy Kingdom, and of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subject therein, as being like the Head and Heart in the Body, from whence all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers receive Life and Nouriſhment. Whereby thy People finding they receive ſo many benefits
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:40348:53"/>from thee, will be always ready to aſſiſt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee, for their own preſervation, as the Members do the Head and Heart. But above all things be careful to ſerve God ſincerely, and aſcribe to him the Glory of all thy Succeſſes againſt thine Enemies, as coming from his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and not any merit of thine.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe and many other good Inſtructions the King gave to his Son. And ſoon after being at his Prayers at St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s Shrine in <hi>Weſtminſter-Abbey,</hi> he was ſuddenly taken with an Apoplexy, and thereupon removed to the Abbot of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>'s Houſe, where recovering himſelf, and finding he was in a ſtrange place, he asked where he was; and being told in the Abbot's Houſe, in a Chamber called <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> (where an Aſtrologer had formerly told him he ſhould dye;) He ſaid, <hi>Nay then I am ſure I ſhall dye,</hi> though he before thought it would have been in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and was therefore prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make a Voyage thither. And here he died indeed <hi>March</hi> 20. 1413. It is obſervable that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his ſickneſs he always required to have his Crown ſet upon his Bolſter by him, and one of his Fits being ſo ſtrong upon him, that all thought him abſolutely dead, the Prince coming in, took away the Crown, when ſuddenly the King recovering his ſenſes and miſſing it, was told the Prince had taken it, who being called, came back with the Crown, and kneeling down ſaid.
<q>Sir, to all our Judgments, and to all our griefs, you ſeemed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly dead, and therefore I took the Crown as my Right, but ſeeing to all our comforts you live, I here deliver it more joyfully than I took it, and pray God you may long live to wear it your ſelf. Well (ſaid the King ſighing) what Right I had to it, God knows. But ſays the Prince, If you dye King, my Sword ſhall maintain it to be my Right againſt all Oppoſers.</q>
               <q> Well, replied the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:40348:54"/>King, I leave all to God, and then turning about ſaid, <hi>God bleſs thee, and have mercy upon me.</hi> 
               </q> And with theſe words he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>After his Father's Death, the Prince was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed King by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> V. and proved a better Man of a King than a Subject, for till then he was not in his right Orb, and therefore no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel he was exorbitant. Thoſe that have taken the height of him, parallell'd him with <hi>Alexander</hi> for Magnanimity, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> for his being Invincible, and Affectation of Glory: but he had ſomething of <hi>Caeſar</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great had not, That he would not be Drunk nor Intemperate, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Alexander</hi> that
<hi>Caeſar</hi> had not, That he would not be flattered: and both were ſhort of him in this, that Conquering others they could not Conquer themſelves, but even when they were Lords of the World, became Slaves to their own Paſſions. He advanced the former Title of the Right of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> and ſent Ambaſſadors to King
<hi>Charles</hi> VI. to demand a peaceable ſurrender of that Crown to him, offering to accept his fair Daughter <hi>Katherine</hi> with the Kingdom, and to expect no other Pledge for his Poſſeſſion till after <hi>Charles</hi>'s Death. But the <hi>French</hi> King being ſick, his Son the Dauphin, who managed the Government, inſtead of another anſwer, ſcornfully ſent the King a Preſent of Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Balls; as an intimation that his Youth was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter acquainted with the uſe of them than of Bullets. The King, whoſe Wit was as Keen as his Sword, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him this anſwer. <hi>That in requital of his fine Preſent of Tennis Balls, it ſhould not be long e're he would toſs ſuch Iron Balls amongſt them, that the beſt Arm in</hi> France
<hi>ſhould not be able to hold a Racket againſt them.</hi> Neither was he worſe than his word, though his Army ſeemed very diſproportionate for ſo great a work, being only (as ſome Write) nine
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40348:54"/>thouſand Horſe and Foot, with which ſmall number he met with the
<hi>French</hi> Army at a place called <hi>Agencourt,</hi> where though the Enemy were above five to one, he fought them with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that he took more Priſoners than his own Forces conſiſted of, and kill'd ten thouſand of them, the Dauphin himſelf dying ſoon after of grief, with the loſs only of ſix hundred <hi>Engliſh;</hi> nay one Author ſays, of not above twenty ſix in all, which made the Victory almoſt miraculous: And which the Religious young King was ſo ſenſible of, that he cauſed the Clergy in his Army to ſing that Pſalm of <hi>David, When</hi> Iſrael <hi>went out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and the Souldiers in their Arms re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponded at every Verſe: <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name be all the Glory.</hi> And up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his return to <hi>England</hi> with his Priſoners, he commanded that no Ballad or Song ſhould be ſung, but thoſe of Thank ſgiving to God for his happy Victory and Safe return, without any reflections upon the <hi>French,</hi> or extolling the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
            <p>Soon after he returned back to <hi>France,</hi> where many great Cities and Towns were Surrendred to him, and the <hi>French</hi> being unable to make any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, at length a Treaty of Peace is concluded, and he married his beloved Lady <hi>Katherine,</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the
<hi>French</hi> King <hi>Charles,</hi> being Proclaimed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of <hi>France</hi> during that King's Life, and Heir Apparent to that Crown after King <hi>Charles</hi> his Death.</p>
            <p>He was tall of Stature, lean of Body, and his Bones ſmall, but ſtrongly made, ſomewhat long Neckt, black Hair'd, and of a very comely Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance. So ſwift in running, that he with two of his Lords would run down a Wild Buck or Doe in a Park. He delighted in Songs and Muſical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and uſed ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pſalms turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:40348:55"/>verſe in his private Chappel. And indeed it may be ſaid of him, that he had ſcarce his equal both for Virtue and Valour. For he ſeldom fought a Battel where he got not the Victory, and never got Victory whereof he gave not the Glory to God with Publick Thankſgiving. He was indeed a great Affector of Glory, yet not of the Glory of the blaſt of Mens Mouths, but of that which fills the Sails of Time. He died of full years, though not full of years. If he had lived longer, he might have gone over the ſame again, but could not have gone further. He fell ſick in <hi>France,</hi> and having given neceſſary inſtructions to the Nobility about him how to manage affairs, he then returned thanks to the Almighty for his many favours and bleſſings, and in the midſt of ſaying a Pſalm of <hi>David</hi> he gave up the Ghoſt: who might have juſtly prayed God with <hi>David, Lord take me not away in the midſt of my days,</hi> for he died about the age of thirty ſix, which in <hi>David</hi>'s account is but half the life of Man. Being dead, his body was imbalmed, cloſed in Lead, and laid in a Chariot Royal richly apparelled in Cloth of Gold, and then conveyed from <hi>Boys de Vincennes</hi> where he died, to <hi>Paris, Roan, Callice, Dover,</hi> and ſo through
<hi>London</hi> to <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> Abbey. Upon whoſe Tomb Queen <hi>Katherine</hi> cauſed a Royal Picture to be laid, covered all over with Silver Plate gilt, but the Head all of Maſſy Silver, which was afterward all ſtoln away. He died <hi>Aug.</hi> 31. 1422. having reigned about nine, and lived about thirty eight years.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Windſor,</hi> his Son and Succeſſor, was the ſixth Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Royal Line, but ſo unlike his Father, that had not the virtues of his Mother been ſo well known as they were, the Virtues of his Father would have rendred this Prince juſtly ſuſpected not to have been his Son, and that his Mother begat him all of her ſelf by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40348:55"/>imagination. His Father ſeemed to have ſome Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Revelation of the future unhappineſs of his Reign, and it was thought the knowledg thereof was not the leaſt cauſe of ſhortning his days. For 'tis credibly reported, that at the news of the Birth of this Son born at <hi>Windſor,</hi> he in a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick rapture cried out, <hi>Good Lord,</hi> Henry

            <p>And yet no doubt <hi>Henry</hi> VI. was a Prince of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts, though not of kindly parts for a Prince, being ſuch as were neither fit for the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Age he was born in, nor agreeable to the Glory he was born to; but ſuch rather as better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Prieſt than a Prince, ſo that the Title which was ſometimes given to his Father with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his Piety, might better have been applied to the Son, <hi>That he was Prince of Prieſts.</hi> Herein only was the difference betwixt them, that the Religion of the one made him bold as a Lion, that of the other made him meek as a Lamb. Whereas if he had leſs of the Dove-like Innocence, and more of the Serpentine ſubtilty, 'tis probable he had not only been happier whilſt he lived, but more reſpected after he was dead: whereas now, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all his Indulgence to the Church and Churchmen, there was none of them ſo grateful, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was Murthered by the Bloody Duke of
<hi>Gloce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>) to give him Chriſtian Burial, but being brought from the Tower to St.
<hi>Paul</hi>'s in an open Coffin bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced where he bled, thence to <hi>Black-Friars,</hi> where he alſo bled: he was carried from thence by Boat to <hi>Chertſey</hi> Abbey, without Prieſt or Clark, Torch or Taper, Maſs or Mourner. Indeed his Burial was ſo without regard to his Perſon or Dignity, that if his Funerals were any whit better than that which the Holy Writ calls the Burial of an Aſs, vet
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40348:56"/>they were ſuch, that his Competitor and Succeſſor King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. who denied him the Rights of Majeſty living, thought him too much wronged being dead, and to make him ſome kind of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, he removed his Corps to <hi>Windſor</hi> Chapel, and there erected a fine Monument over him.</p>
            <p>In this King we may ſee the fulfilling of that Text, <hi>Wo to that Nation whoſe King is a Child,</hi> for he was not above eight months old when he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded his Father in the Kingdom, though this Text may be meant as well of a Child in under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding as years. The firſt defect may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by good Governors or Protectors, but the laſt is hardly to be repaired, of which in this Prince we have a pregnant inſtance, For ſo long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Child in years, his Kingdoms were kept flouriſhing by the Providence of his careful Uncles, but ſo ſoon as he left being a Child in years, and yet continued a Child in Ability of Ruling, having not the judgment to conceal his own weakneſs, then preſently Faction and Ambition broke in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Government, ſo that all things went to wrack both in <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> and we were forced to ſurrender tamely all our Foreign Acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which we had obtained with ſo much Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Glory. This King being Crowned King of
<hi>France</hi> at <hi>Paris</hi> in 1431.</p>
            <p>He was tall of Stature, ſpare and ſlender of Body, of a comely Countenance, and in all parts well proportioned. For endowments of his mind, he had Virtues enough to make a Saint, but not a King. He was ſenſible of that which the World calls Honour, accounting the greateſt honour to conſiſt in humility. He was not ſo ſtupid not to know Proſperity from Adverſity, but he was ſo devout as to think nothing adverſity which was not an hindrance to Devotion. He had one privilege peculiar to himſelf, that no man could ever be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:40348:56"/>on him, ſeeing he never offered any man injury. He was ſo modeſt, that when at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> a ſhow of Women was preſented to him with their naked Breaſts, he preſently departed, ſaying, <hi>Fie, Fie for ſhame, forſooth you are to blame.</hi> So pitiful that when he ſaw the Quarters of a Traytor over <hi>Cripplegate,</hi> he cauſed them to be taken down, ſaying: <hi>I will not have any Chriſtian ſo cruelly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led for my ſake.</hi> So free from ſwearing, that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſed any other Oath but forſooth, and verily. So patient, that to one who ſtruck him when he was taken Priſoner, he only ſaid,
<hi>Forſooth you wrong your ſelf more than me to ſtrike the Lord's anointed.</hi> So Devout, that on principal Holy-days he uſed to wear Sackcloth next his Skin. In fine, let his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor be heard, who in ten years Confeſſion never found that he had ſaid or done any thing worthy of a Reprimand. For all which Chriſtian Virtues King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. would have procured him to be Canonized for a Saint, but that he was prevented by Death, or perhaps becauſe the charge would have been too great, the Canonization of a King being much dearer than that of a private Perſon. He reigned thirty eight, and lived fifty nine years, and was murthered in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> in 1472.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Edward</hi> the only Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. by Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter to the King of <hi>Sicily,</hi> was the ſeventh Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> of the Royal Blood of <hi>England.</hi> He Married <hi>Anne</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Nevil</hi> called the Great Earl of <hi>Warwick;</hi> After his Father's Army was defeated by King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> IV. at <hi>Tauton</hi> Field in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> he with his Mother were ſent into
<hi>France</hi> to pray aid from that King. This Battel was the bloodieſt that ever
<hi>England</hi> ſaw, King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Army conſiſting in threeſcore thouſand, and King <hi>Edward</hi>'s in about forty thouſand men, of which there fell that day
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:40348:57"/>thirty ſeven thouſand ſeven hundred ſeventy ſix Perſons, no Priſoners being taken but the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> Afterward the Queen returns from
<hi>France</hi> with ſome Forces, but before her coming King <hi>Edward</hi> had defeated the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> (who with ſome other Lords had raiſed a Party for her aſſiſtance) at <hi>Barnet,</hi> wherein near ten thouſand were ſlain. So that when it was too late ſhe landed at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and from thence went to <hi>Bewly</hi> Abbey in
<hi>Hampſhire,</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> and divers other Lords came to her, reſolving once more to try their Fortune in the Field. The Queen was very deſirous that her Son <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſhould have returned to <hi>France,</hi> there to have been ſecure, till the ſucceſs of the next Battel had been tried, but the Lords, eſpecially the Duke of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſet,</hi> would not conſent to it, ſo that ſhe was obliged to comply with them, though ſhe quickly repented it. From
<hi>Bewly</hi> ſhe with the Prince and the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> goes to
<hi>Briſtol,</hi> deſigning to miſe what men they could in <hi>Gloceſterſhire,</hi> and to march into <hi>Wales</hi> and join <hi>Jaſper</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> who was there aſſembling more Forces. K. <hi>Edward</hi> having intelligence of their Proceedings reſolves to prevent their conjunction, and follows Queen <hi>Margaret</hi> ſo diligently with a great Army, that near <hi>Tewksbury</hi> in <hi>Gloceſterſhire</hi> he overtakes her Forces, who reſolutely turn to ingage him. The Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> led the Van, and performed the part of a Valiant Commander, but finding his Soldiers through wearineſs begin to faint, and that the Lord <hi>Wenlock</hi> who commanded the main Battel moved not, he rode up to him and upbraiding his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, with his Pole-ax inſtantly knockt out his Brains, but before he could bring this Party to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Van, they were wholly defeated, the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> with above three thouſand of the

All whom, except the Queen, were the next day Beheaded. At which time Sir <hi>Rich. Crofts</hi> preſented to King <hi>Edward,</hi> King
<hi>Henry</hi>'s Son <hi>Edward,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> To whom King <hi>Edward</hi> at firſt ſeemed indifferent kind, but demanding of him how he durſt ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly enter into his Realm with Arms? The Prince replied, though truly, yet unſeaſonably, <hi>To recover my Father's Kingdom and my Inheritance.</hi> Thereupon King <hi>Edward</hi> with his hand thruſt him from him, or as ſome ſay, ſtruck him on the Face with his Gauntlet, and then preſently <hi>George</hi> Duke of <hi>Clarence, Thomas Grey</hi> Marqueſs <hi>Dorſet,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Haſtings</hi> ſtanding by, fell upon him in the place and murthered him. Others write, that Crook-back'd <hi>Richard</hi> ran him into the Heart with his Dagger. His Body was Buried with other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Corps that were ſlain, in the Church of the Monaſtery of the

            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Edward</hi> eldeſt Son of King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. was the eighth Prince of

            <p n="9">IX. <hi>Richard</hi> only Son of King <hi>Richard</hi> III. was the ninth Prince of

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:40348:58"/>
               <hi>Richmond</hi> in the County of <hi>York.</hi> At four years old he was created Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> by his Uncle King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. At ten years old he was created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> by his Father King <hi>Richard</hi> III. but died ſoon after.</p>
            <p n="10">X. <hi>Arthur</hi> eldeſt Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. was the tenth Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> of the Royal <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. He was born at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in the ſecond year of his Father's Reign. When he was about fifteen years old, his Father propoſed a Marriage for him with the Princeſs <hi>Katherine</hi> Daughter to <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which being concluded, the Lady was ſent by her Father with a gallant Fleet of Ships to <hi>England,</hi> and arrived at <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Soon after the Princeſs was openly eſpouſed to Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> they were both clad in white, he being fifteen, and ſhe eighteen years of age. At night they were put together in one Bed, where they lay as Man and Wife all that Night. When morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appeared, the Prince (as his Servants about him reported) called for Drink, which was not uſual with him. Whereof one of his Bed-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber asking him the cauſe, he merrily replied: <hi>I have been this Night in the midſt of</hi> Spain <hi>which is a hot Country, and that makes me ſo dry.</hi> Though ſome write, that a grave Matron was laid in Bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to hinder actual Conſummation. The Ladie's Dowry was two hundred thouſand Duckets, and her Jointure the third part of the Principality of <hi>Wales, Cornwal</hi> and
<hi>Cheſter.</hi> At this Marriage was great Solemnity and Roval Juſtings. Prince
<hi>Arthur</hi> after his Marriage was ſent into <hi>Wales,</hi> to keep his Country in good Order, having ſeveral prudent and able Counſellors to adviſe with, but within five Months after, he died at his Caſtle at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> and with great ſolemnity was Buried in the Cathedral of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> He was a very ingenious and learned Prince, for though he lived not to be
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:40348:58"/>ſixteen years old, yet he was ſaid to have read over all or moſt of the Latin Fathers, beſides many others. Some attribute the ſhortneſs of his Life to his Nativity, being born in the eighth month after Conception.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond Son to King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. was the eleventh Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the Royal <hi>Engliſh</hi> Line. He was born at <hi>Greenwich</hi> in
<hi>Kent.</hi> After the Death of his eldeſt Brother Prince <hi>Arthur,</hi> the Title of Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was by his Father's Order not given to him, but his own only, of Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> till the Women could certainly diſcover whether the Lady <hi>Katherine</hi> were with Child or not. But after ſix months when nothing appeared, he had his Title beſtowed upon him, and King <hi>Henry</hi> being loth to part with her great Portion, prevailed with his Son
<hi>Henry,</hi> (though not without ſome reluctancy in one ſo young as himſelf, for he was ſcarce twelve years of age) to be contracted to the Princeſs his Brother's Widow, for which Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage a Diſpenſation, by advice of the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men at that time in
<hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> was by Pope <hi>Julius</hi> II. granted, and ſo the Marriage was So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnized ſoon after at the Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Fleetſtreet.</hi> After the Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſucceeded to the Crown by the name of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. His reign was long, and full of action, but the greateſt was his renouncing the Pope's Supremacy, and ſuppreſſing of many unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Abbeys, and Monaſteries, and thereby lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Foundation for the happy Reformation that followed.</p>
            <p>He was exceeding tall of Stature, very Strong, and fair of Complexion. A Prince of ſo many good Parts, that it may be wondred he had any ill, reither indeed had he many, till flattery and ill Counſel in his latter time prevailed upon him. His cruelty to his Wives ſome endeavour to excuſe,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:40348:59"/>by ſaying, that if they were Incontinent he did but Juſtice: If they were not ſo, yet he thought it ſufficient to ſatisfie his Conſcience that he had cauſe to believe them ſo, and if Marriage be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in all, in Princes it is ſacred. In ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Abbeys he ſhewed no little Piety but great Providence, for though they were excellent things being rightly uſed, the moſt pernicious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuſed; and then may the uſe be juſtly ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when the abuſe can ſcarce poſſibly be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. To think he ſuppreſt them from Covetouſneſs, is to make him extreamly deceived in his reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for by comparing the profit with the charge, he muſt needs be a great loſer by the bargain. He was ſo far from Pride, that he was rather too humble. At leaſt he converſed with his Subjects in a more familiar manner than is uſual with Princes. So Valiant that his whole Life almoſt was exerciſes of Valour, and though performed among his Friends in Jeſt, yet they prepared him againſt his Enemies in earneſt, and they that durſt be his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, found it ſo. It may be ſaid, the complexion of his Government for the firſt twenty years was Sanguine and Jovial, for the reſt, cholerick and bloody, ſo that it is a queſtion, whether in the former he were more prodigal of his own Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or in the latter part, of his Subjects Blood. For as he ſpent more in Masks, Shews, and Fictions, than any other King did in reality, ſo in any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempes of his People he uſed no other Phyſick but to open a Vein.</p>
            <p>But it will be injurious to his Memory to charge all the Blood ſpilt in his Reign to his account. They were the Popiſh Biſhops that made thoſe Bloody Laws, and the bloody Biſhops that put them in execution, the King oftentimes ſcarce knowing what was done. Certain it is, when Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Gardiner</hi> put a Gentlewoman (I ſuppoſe Mrs.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:40348:59"/>
               <hi>Ann Askew</hi>) a ſecond time on the Rack, the King hearing of it, extreamly condemned him for ſuch Barbarous cruelty. As for Religion though he brought it not to a full Reformation, yet he gave a good beginning thereunto. They that charge him with the Vice of Luſt, let them ſhew ſuch another example of Continence as was ſeen in him, to lye ſix months by a young Lady and not to touch her, for ſo he did by the Lady <hi>Ann</hi> of
<hi>Cleve.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded of him, that in his latter time he grew ſo fat and ſlothful, that Engines were made to lift and remove him up and down, but however in the fifty ſixth year of his age, either by a Dropſie or an Ulcer in his Leg he fell into a languiſhing Feaver, which brought him into ſuch extremity, that his Phyſicians utterly deſpaired of his Life, and yet none durſt acquaint him with it, till Mr. <hi>Denny</hi> of his Privy Chamber ventured to tell him of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and put him in mind of preparing for Death. To which he anſwered, that he confeſſed his Sins to be exceeding great, yet he had ſuch confidence in the Mercy of God through Chriſt Jeſus, that he doubted not of forgiveneſs though they had been much greater. And being asked whether he would have a Divine, he anſwered he would willingly have Archbiſhop
<hi>Cranmer,</hi> but not till he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a little reſt. The Archbiſhop being then at
<hi>Croyden</hi> was ſent for, but before he came the King was grown ſpeechleſs, only ſeemed ſomewhat ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, putting out his hand. And the Archbiſhop deſiring him to ſhew ſome ſign of his Faith in Chriſt he then wrung him hard by the hand, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave up the Ghoſt. <hi>Jan.</hi> 28. 1547. in the fifty ſixth year-of his age, and of his reign the thirty eighth. His body with great ſolemnity was Buried at <hi>Windſor</hi> under a very ſtately Tomb, begun in Copper and Gilt, but never finiſhed.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:40348:60"/>XII. <hi>Edward</hi> the only Son and Succeſſor of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. was the twelfth Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Race. He was an excellent Prince, in his tender years, being committed to the Tuition of Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> he profited in Learning to admiration, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in a ſhort time to ſpeak freely ſeveral Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, namely, Greek, Latin, French, Italian, Spaniſh and Dutch, and likewiſe had great know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in many other Sciences, ſo that he ſeemed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be born than to be brought up to them: for he was not ignorant of Logick, natural Philoſophy, nor Muſick, and in the midſt of his youthful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations be would be always ſure to obſerve his hours for ſtudy. So that the famous
<hi>Cardanus</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into <hi>England,</hi> and having often conference with him, gives this Character of him, That he had an extraordinary inſight into the Politicks, was well read in Philoſophy and Divinity, and in a word a Miracle of Art and Nature. He would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer Ambaſſadors on the ſudden, either in <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin.</hi> He knew the ſtate of Foreign Princes perfectly, and his own more. He could call all the Gentlemen of Quality in his Kingdom by their Names, and all when he had ſcarce yet attained to the age of fifteen years. He was extraordinary zealous in the True Religion, baniſhing Popery and perfecting that Reformation which was but juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in his Father's Reign. He was very merciful, and averſe from taking away the Lives of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, for proof whereof there is this inſtance. One <hi>Joan Butcher</hi> being condemned to be burnt for notorious Blaſphemy and Hereſie, his whole Council could not perſuade him to ſign the Warrant for her execution, but were fain to get Archbiſhop
<hi>Cranmer</hi> to prevail with him, who uſing many arguments to perſuade him, <hi>What</hi> ſaid he, <hi>would you have me ſend her quick to the Devil in her Error.</hi> But when the Biſhop ſhewed him the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:40348:60"/>neceſſity of it, he ſigned it weeping, and ſaying, <hi>Well, my Lord, I will lay all the blame upon you at the Day of Judgment.</hi> He was very Charitable, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Sermon preached by Biſhop <hi>Ridley</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Charity, he gave and endowed three Hoſpitals for the Poor in the City of <hi>London:</hi> 1. <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Hoſpital, for poor Children and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans. 2. St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>'s Hoſpital for poor, maimed, diſeaſed People and Cripples, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 3. <hi>Bridewell,</hi> for imploying and correcting Vagrants, Harlots, and Idle Perſons.</p>
            <p>He was a Comely Perſon, and of a ſweet Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, eſpecially in his Eyes, which ſeemed to have a ſtarry livelineſs in them. In the ſixth year of his Reign, which was the year before he died, he fell ſick of the Meaſels, and being fully recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he rode a Progreſs with greater magnificence than ever he had done before, having in his Train no fewer than four thouſand Horſe. The <hi>January</hi> following, whether procured by ſiniſter Practice, or growing upon him by natural infirmity, he fell into an indiſpoſition which centred in a Cough of the Lungs. Whereupon it was reported that a Poiſoned Noſegay had been preſented him for a New years Gift, which brought him into this ſlow but mortal Conſumption. Others ſaid, it was done by a vene nous Clyſter. However it was, he grew ſo ill that his Phyſicians diſpaired of his Life. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which a Gentlewoman, though to be provided on purpoſe, pretended to cure him, but did him much hurt, for with her applications his Legs ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his Pulſe failed, his skin changed colour and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſymptonis of approaching death appeared. An hour before he was overheard to pray thus by himſelf:
<q>O Lord God, deliver me out of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and wretched Life. O Lord thou knoweſt how happy it were for me to be with thee, yet for thy Choſens ſake, if it be thy will ſend me life and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40348:61"/>health that I may truly ſerve thee. O Lord God ſave thy choſen People of
<hi>England,</hi> and defend this Realm from Papiſtry, and maintain thy true Religion that I and my People may praiſe thy name, for thy Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. </q> Then turning his Face and ſeeing ſome by him, he ſaid, <hi>I thought you had not been ſo nigh: Yes,</hi> ſaid Dr. <hi>Owen, we heard you ſpeak to your ſelf.</hi> Then ſaid the King <hi>I was Praying to God, O I am faint, Lord have mercy upon me, and receive my Spirit,</hi> and in ſo ſaying he gave up the Ghoſt, <hi>July</hi> 6. 1553. in the ſixteenth year of his age, when he had reigned ſix years-five months, and nine days, and was ſolemnly buried at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. Prince <hi>Henry</hi> eldeſt Son to King <hi>James</hi> I. was the thirteenth Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> of the Royal Family of <hi>England.</hi> He was born at <hi>Sterling</hi> Caſtle in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and in his Childhood gave promiſing ſigns of an Heroick and Noble Spirit, no Muſick being ſo pleaſant to his Ears as the Trumpet and Drum, and the roaring of Cannon, and no ſights ſo acceptable as that of Muſquets, Piſtols, and any kind of Armour: and at nine years of age he learned to ride, ſhoot at Archery, leap, and manage the Pike, all which manly exerciſes he performed to admiration in ſuch young years. He was tall of ſtature about five foot eight inches high, of an amiable, yet Majeſtick countenance, a piercing Eye, a gracious ſmile, and a terrible frown, yet cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and affable to all. He was naturally modeſt and patient, and when moſt offended, he would by over-coming himſelf ſay nothing, very merciful, very juſt, and very true to his promiſes, very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and reſerved from his youth. He was moſt zealous in his love to Religion and Piety, and his Heart was bent if he had lived, to have endeavoured to compound thoſe differences that were among Religious men. He ſhewed his love to good men,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40348:61"/>and hatred of evil in incouraging good Preachers, and ſlighting the vain-glorious, in whom above all things he abhorr'd flattery, loving and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing the good, and never ſpeaking of the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Preachers without anger and diſdain. He was very Conſciencious of an Oath, ſo that he was never heard to take God's name in vain, or any other Oaths that may ſeem light, much leſs ſuch horrible Oaths as are now too common. He never failed to ſacrifice daily the firſt of his actions to God by Prayers and Devotions. He was ſo reſolved to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue immutable in the Proteſtant Religion, that long before his death he ſolemnly proteſted, <hi>That he would never join in Marriage with a Wife of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Faith,</hi> for he hated Popery with all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts and Adherents thereof, yet he would now and then uſe particular Papiſts kindly, thereby ſhewing that he hated not their Perſons but Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. He was obedient to his Parents, careful in the affairs of his Family and Revenue, loving and kind to Strangers, and in a word he had a certain extraordinary excellency that cannot be expreſt in words. In the nineteenth year of his age he was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited with a continual Head-ach, and had two ſmall Fits of an Ague, which were afterward followed with very had ſymptoms, which daily increaſing, Dr. <hi>Abbot</hi> then Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> went to viſit him, and finding the extream danger he was in, diſcourſt to him of the vanity of the World, the certainty of Death and the Joys of Heaven, asking his Highneſs, whether he were well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to die now if it were the Will of God, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, <hi>Yes with all my Heart,</hi> farther declaring, That he hoped for the pardon of his ſins only from the merits of Chriſt. In his beſt moments he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in a Chriſtian frame of Spirit, and <hi>Novemb.</hi> 6. 1612. quietly yielded up his Spirit to his bleſſed Saviour and Redeemer, being attended with as

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wales</hi> is ſituated on the Weſt and Northweſt part of <hi>England,</hi> over againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and appears like a Promontory o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Foreland, being ſurrounded by the Sea almoſt on every ſide, except on the South-Eaſt part, where it is divided from <hi>England</hi> by the River
<hi>Severn,</hi> and by a Ditch drawn from the Mouth of the River <hi>Dee</hi> to the mouth of the River <hi>Wye,</hi> being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles from Eaſt to Weſt, and an hundred and twenty Miles from North to South. The fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Ditch is called <hi>Claudh Offa</hi> becauſe made by
<hi>Offa</hi> King <hi>Mercia,</hi> of a great depth and breadth, thereby to confine the
<hi>Welſh</hi> into narrower limits who enacted, That if any <hi>Welſhman</hi> were found on the Eaſt ſide of this Ditch he ſhould forfeit his right hand, but that Law is long ſince repealed, and the Loyal and Valiant <hi>Welſh</hi> have for ſeveral ages paſt enjoyed the ſame Liberties and Privileges with the other Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was divided into three parts, that is <hi>North-Wales, South-Wales</hi> and
<hi>Powis-Land,</hi> by <hi>Roderick</hi> the Great in 877. as you have heard, which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the confuſion of <hi>Wales;</hi> their Princes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at War with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to inlarge and defend their ſeveral Dominions
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40348:63"/>Of theſe three, <hi>North-Wales</hi> was the chief, being left to
<hi>Amarawd</hi> the eldeſt Son of <hi>Roderick,</hi> the Princes whereof by way of eminency were ſtiled Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſometimes Kings of <hi>Aberfrow</hi> their Chief Reſidence, and paid to the King of <hi>London,</hi> (as well as the Princes of
<hi>South-Wales</hi> and <hi>Powis-Land</hi>) ſixty three pounds yearly as a Tribute. Yet
<hi>South-Wales,</hi> called by the Inhabitants <hi>Dehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barth,</hi> or the right ſide, as being nearer the Sun, was the largeſt, moſt fruitful and rich, but more ſubject to the Invaſions and Depredations of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Flemings,</hi> and therefore
<hi>North-Wales</hi> being ſecured by its Hills and Mountains was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd before it, and retaineth more of the purity of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Tongue. However this makes the ſoil lean and hungry, but that is ſupplied by the large quantity thereof, which occaſioned this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant paſſage. An <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentleman in diſcourſe with a worſhipful Knight of
<hi>Wales,</hi> boaſting that that he had in <hi>England</hi> ſo much ground worth 40 s. an Acre, the <hi>Welſh</hi> Gentleman replied, <hi>You have ten yards of Velvet, and I have two hundred yards of Frize, I will not exchange with you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are likewiſe in <hi>Wales</hi> very pleaſant Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows Watered by fine Rivers, and as the ſweeteſt Fleſh is ſaid to be near the Bones, ſo the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Valleys are interpoſed betwixt theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The Natives are generally, healthy, ſtrong, ſwift and witty, which is imputed to the clear and wholeſome Air of the Mountains, the cleanly and moderate Diet of the People and the hardſhip to which they are inured from their Childhood. The Ancient
<hi>Britains</hi> painted their naked Bodies with Pictures of living Creatures, Flowers, Sun, Moon and Stars, thereby as they imagined to appear ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to their Enemies, yet ſome more civil were clothed, and as a great Ornament, wore Chains of Iron about their Waſts and Neck, and Rings on
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:40348:64"/>their middle Fingers. They wore the Hair of their Head long, which was naturally curled in many. All other parts they ſhaved, only wore long Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on their upper Lip. They had ten or twelve Wives a piece, who lived in common among their Parents and Brethren; yet the Children were only accounted his who firſt married the Mother while ſhe was a Maid: They were brought up in common among them. They were moderate in their Diet, as Milk, Roots, and Barks of Trees, and a little thing no bigger than a Bean, which for a great while took away both Hunger and Thirſt; Neither would they eat Hens, Hares, Geeſe, nor Fiſh; yet would often Dine upon Veniſon and Fruits. Their uſual Drink was made of Barly. They are report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by
<hi>Plutarch</hi> to have lived very long, many to an hundred and twenty years.</p>
            <p>They were Idolatrous Heathens as to their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, uſing Man's Fleſh in their Sacrifices, and adoring a multitude of Idols. Their Prieſts were called <hi>Druids,</hi> who managed their Sacrifices, and likewiſe acted as Temporal Judges in all Civil Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and it was highly criminal not abide by their Judgment. They were excuſed from the Wars, and all contributions. They had a Primate, who commanded over them in chief. Their Divinity was, <hi>That the Soul is immortal, and paſſeth from one Body to another:</hi> which Doctrine they taught not out of Books, but by word of Mouth. Their Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were low mean Cottages, like thoſe of the
<hi>Gauls,</hi> or Boors of <hi>France;</hi> yet they fortified ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thick Woods with Rampires and Ditches, which they called Towns. Braſs and Iron Rings were the Coin they uſed, which were of a certain weight; but afterward they grew more civil by Traffick, and had both Gold and Silver Money. Their chief Trade was in Chains, Wreaths, Ivory Boxes, Bitts and Bridles, with ſome Toys of Amber
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:40348:64"/>and Glaſs. Neither was their Shipping more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, their cheif Veſſels being made of light wood, covered over with Leather: Their uſual way of Fighting was in Military Chariots; neither did they engage in great bodies, but had ſtill freſh men to ſucceed thoſe who retired, or were weary. Their weapons were Shields and ſhort Spears, at the lower end whereof was faſtned a round Bell of Braſs; with which they terrified their Enemies. Many times they fought under the Conduct of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Women, who were extraordinary couragious. They managed their Chariots ſo dexterouſly, that running downa ſteep Hill with all ſpeed, they could ſtop them in the middle of their courſe.</p>
            <p>The Principality of <hi>Wales</hi> produceth Mines, and among others, Royal Mines of Silver in
<hi>Cardigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> in the Mountains of <hi>Coſmelock, Tallabant, Gadarren, Bromfloid, Geginnon</hi> and <hi>Cummerrum.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> began to Mine here, as appears by their Coins found in the Trenches wherein they work'd about twenty four fathom deep, and found plenty of Lead. The <hi>Danes</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> wrought an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred farhom deep, and gained mhch Lead till the Waters drowned their Works. Sir <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Silver in
<hi>Coſmelock</hi> in the latter end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign. Which deſign was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted after his Death by Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton,</hi> Coyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Silver to his great charge at the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> as his Predeceſſor had done. Next Sir <hi>F. Godolphin</hi> of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Tho. Buſhel</hi> Eſquire undertook it, having power from King <hi>Charles</hi> I. to Coyn it at <hi>Aberruski</hi> in that County. Sir <hi>Francis</hi> dying and <hi>Coſmelock</hi> being deſerted, Mr. <hi>Buſhel</hi> adventured on the other five Mountains, and at laſt theſe Mines yielded an hundred pound a week, and half ſo much more in Lead. The Silver was Coyned into Pence, Groats, Shillings and Half Crowns, and had the Oſtrich Feathers, being the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:40348:65"/>Arms of the Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſtampt on them for diſtinction. They had an ingenious invention to ſupply the Miners with freſh Air, which was done by two mens blowing Wind with a pair of Bellows on the outſide of the entrance into a Pipe of Lead, which was daily lengthened as the Mine grew lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger whereby the Candle in the Mine was daily kept burning, and the Diggers were conſtantly ſupplied with a ſufficiency of Breath. But the Civil Wars in
1642. diſcompoſed all the Work. Lead is found in many places in <hi>Wales,</hi> but the beſt in <hi>Carnarvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> There are plenty of Goats in <hi>Montgomery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> As for Manufactures, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> generally valuing themſelves more upon their Gentile Birth and Extraction, are better pleaſed in imploying their Valour than Labour, and therefore they had but few Commodities, as Cottons and Frieze, of which King <hi>Henry</hi> V. when Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> having a ſuit, and being checkt by a bold Courtier for wearing the ſame many weeks together,
<q>I wiſh, ſaid he, that the Cloth of my Country would laſt forever.</q> Then they have Cheeſe very tender and palatable, the Pedigree whereof was by one thus merrily derived.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Adam</hi>'s nawn Cuſſon was by her Birth ap Curds, ap Milk, ap Cow, ap Graſs, ap Earth. They have likewiſe <hi>Metheglin,</hi> firſt invented by <hi>Matthew Glin</hi> their own Countreyman, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Milk and Honey, and very wholeſome. <hi>Pollio Romulus</hi> being an hundred years of age, told <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> "That he had preſerved the vigor of his Mind and Body by taking Metheglin inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and uſing Oyl outwardly. It is like Mead but much ſtronger, Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who by the <hi>Tuders</hi> was of <hi>Welſh</hi> Deſcent, much loved this her Native Liquor.</p>
            <p>The Buildings of <hi>Wales,</hi> are generally like thoſe of the old <hi>Britains,</hi> neither large nor beautiful,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:40348:65"/>the <hi>Italian</hi> humour of Building not having affected (not to ſay infected) the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation. About the year 800 <hi>Hoell-Dha</hi> Prince of
<hi>Wales</hi> built a Palace for his own Reſidence of white Hurdles or Wattles, and therefore called <hi>White-Houſe,</hi> or <hi>White-Hall</hi> if you pleaſe. However there are brave buildings in <hi>Wales,</hi> though not <hi>Welſh</hi> build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> erected therein as Bridles to keep the People of that Countrey in obedience ſome Authors derive the name of <hi>Wales</hi> from <hi>Id<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallo</hi> the Son of <hi>Cadwalladar,</hi> who with the ſmall remainder of his <hi>Britiſh</hi> Subjects defended the dangerous places of this Country againſt his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and firſt was called King of <hi>Wales.</hi> Neither was the Conqueſt of them to be attributed to their want of Valour, ſince King <hi>Henry</hi> II. in a Letter to
<hi>Emanuel</hi> Emperor of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> gives this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of them,
<q>The <hi>Welſh</hi> Nation is ſo adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous that they dare encounter naked with arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, ready to ſpend their Blood for their Country, and pawn their Life for Praiſe.</q> 
            </p>
            <p>Thus far of <hi>Wales</hi> in general, I ſhall now give an account of the moſt memorable Perſons, Places, Accidents, Rarities and Wonders in every County thereof, particularly, in Alphabetical Order, (as I have formerly done in the Counties of <hi>England</hi>) the names whereof are <hi>Angleſey, Brecknock, Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, Carmarthen, Carnarvan, Denbigh, Flint, Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morgan, Merioneth, Monmouth, Montgomery, Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Radnor,</hi> of all which I have made ſome few Remarks in the Tract aforementioned, but ſhall now be more large and copious, not omitting any thing that I can meet with remarkable. And firſt of</p>
            <p>
               <hi>ANGLESEY</hi> called by the <hi>Britains Tir Mon</hi> or the Land of <hi>Mon,</hi> in Latin
<hi>Mona,</hi> and by the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Angleſey</hi> or the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Iſland, being ſeparate from the Continent, and ſurrounded on all ſides by
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:40348:66"/>the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, ſave on the South, where it is join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſmall and narrow ſtreight of the River <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and almoſt ſquare, containing twenty Miles from <hi>Beumaris</hi> to <hi>Holy-Head</hi> Eaſt and Weſt, and from
<hi>Llanbaderick</hi> North to the Point of <hi>Menai</hi> South ſeventeen, in the whole Circuit about ſeventy Miles. The Air is generally healthy, and the Soil ſeemingly barren, but really fruitful, affording Corn and Cattel ſufficient both for the Natives and their Neighbours, and therefore the <hi>Welſh</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is, <hi>Mon Mam Cymbry, Angleſey</hi> is the Mother of
<hi>Wales,</hi> becauſe when other Countries fail, this plentifully feeds their Markets, and is ſaid to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Cormenough to ſupply all <hi>Wales.</hi> This Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty produceth likewiſe the beſt Mill-ſtones to Grind it: Alſo Allum and Coperas, and in divers places in the low Fields and Champain Grounds, there are ſeveral Trees digged up, black within like Ebony, and are uſed by Carvers for inlaying Cupboards. yea Haſlenuts are found under ground with found Kernels in them. It is hard to reſolve how they came hither, ſome imagine the <hi>Romans</hi> cut them down as being Coverts for their Enemies. Others think they fell of themſelves, and with their own weight were buried in thoſe Marſhy places, and that the clammy Bituminous ſubſtance which is found about them, keeps them from putrefaction.</p>
            <p>The Antient Inhabitants of this Country were the <hi>Ordovices,</hi> and this very Iſland that antient and renowned ſeat of the <hi>Britiſh Druids,</hi> the Conqueſt whereof was firſt attempted by <hi>Paulinus Suetonius</hi> in the reign of the Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> who making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to Invade the ſame, the Inhabitants that were ſtrong and numerous, by the aſſiſtance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fugitives, raiſed all the Forces they were able, and ſtood ready upon the Shoar to reſiſt and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Landing, their Women running about with their Hair about their Ears, and Fire-brands in
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:40348:66"/>their hands, in mourning Garments like Furies of Hell, and their Druids or Prieſts with Hands and Eyes lifted up to Heaven, uttered many direful Curſes, and Imprecations, and cried for Vengeauce againſt their Enemies. The ſtrangeneſs of the ſight ſo amazed the
<hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, that they ſeemed to offer themſelves as a prey to the Swords of the
<hi>Britains,</hi> had not their Captain ſuddenly rowzed them out of their ſurprize, by reminding them of their antient Valour which ſeemed now to be loſt, only at the ſight of a fearful Flock of weak Women, and a crew of rude, undiſciplined, frantick men: This brisk reprimand awakened their courage, ſo that diſplaying their Euſigns and Marching toward them, the <hi>Britains</hi> were inſtantly defeated, ſlain, and put to flight, and the
<hi>Romans</hi> became Maſters both of the Field of Battel and the whole Iſland alſo, yet were they not wholly ſubdued till the Reign of <hi>Julius Agricola.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in <hi>Britain</hi> began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline ſeveral <hi>Iriſh,</hi> came ſecretly over and ſetled here, and certain ſinall Hills and Mounts are yet to be ſeen, intrenched about, which are called the <hi>Iriſh-men</hi>'s Cottages, and another place named of the <hi>Iriſh-men Hiercy Gwidil,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid they here put the <hi>Britains</hi> to flight under the conduct of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigus.</hi> Afterward the <hi>Normans</hi> oſt infeſted this Iſle, but in the year 1000 King <hi>Etheldred</hi> ſet out a Fleet which ſcoured the Seas round about it, and waſted the Countrey in a more hoſtile manner than either the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> or <hi>Norwegians.</hi> Then <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi> and
<hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> both <hi>Normans</hi> did grievouſly afflict
<hi>Angleſey,</hi> at which very time <hi>Magnus</hi> the <hi>Norwegian</hi> arriving here, ſhot <hi>Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> through with an Arrow, and after he had plundred the Iſland departed. Next, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> continually vext the Inhabitants, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral deſcents upon them even to the time
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:40348:67"/>of King <hi>Edward</hi> I. when they were totally ſubject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that Crown.</p>
            <p>The chief Town <hi>Beumaris</hi> formerly called <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> built by this King
<hi>Edward</hi> I. (together with a ſtrong Caſtle) is governed by a Mayor, two Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs, two Sergeants at Mace, and a Town Clerk. At <hi>Llanvais</hi> not far from hence, was formerly a Monaſtery of Friars Minors, richly endowed by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> where a Daughter of King <hi>John,</hi> and the Son of a <hi>Daniſh</hi> King, with ſeveral other perſons of Dignity were Buried that were ſlain in the Wars between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Welſh.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Guido de Mona,</hi> or of <hi>Angleſey</hi> was Biſhop of St. <hi>David's,</hi> and Lord Treaſurer of <hi>England</hi> to King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. though the Parliament moved that no
<hi>Welſhman</hi> ſhould be a State Officer in <hi>England.</hi> He died 1407. <hi>Arthur Bulkley</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> though bred Doctor of the Laws, either never read, or elſe he had forgot the Chapter againſt Sacrilege, for he ſpoiled the Biſhoprick, and ſold the five Bells of the Cathedral, being ſo over officious that he would go down to the Sea to ſee them ſhipt away. He was ſuddenly deprived of his ſight, and died 1555. <hi>William Glyn</hi> D. D. bred in and Maſter of Queen's College was made Biſhop of <hi>Bangor</hi> in the ſecond year of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> an excellent Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar being conſtant to his own and not cruel to the Profeſſors of the Proteſtant Religion, there being no Perſecution in his Dioceſs. He died the firſt year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whoſe Brother <hi>Jeffery</hi> Dr. of Laws, Built and Endowed a Free School at <hi>Bangor.</hi>

               <hi>Madoc</hi> Son to <hi>Owen Gwineth</hi> Brother to <hi>David</hi> Prince of
<hi>North-Wales</hi> was born probably at <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frow</hi> in this County, then the principal Palace of their Royal Reſidence, who upon the Civil Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his own Countrey in 1170 adventured to Sea, and leaving <hi>Ireland</hi> on the North came to a

<hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Monmouthſhire</hi> Eaſt, in breadth twenty eight, and in length twenty Miles. It is full of Hills, and difficult in Travelling. The Mountains of <hi>Talgar</hi> and <hi>Ewias</hi> on the Eaſt ſeem to defend it from the exceſſive heat of the Sun, which makes an wholeſome and temperate Air, from whence likewiſe riſe many curious Springs that render the Valleys fruitful both in Corn and Graſs, and thereby make amends for their own barrenneſs. The <hi>Silures</hi> were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Inhabitants of this County, who valiantly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the <hi>Roman</hi> ſervitude, and were firſt ſubdued by <hi>Julius Frontinus,</hi> who found it more difficult to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:40348:68"/>encounter with the Hills, Streights and Mountains than with the People, whereof one Mountain in the South is of ſuch an height and occult quality that faith Mr.
<hi>Speed,</hi> I ſhould bluſh to relate it, had I not the Aldermen and Bayliffs of the Town of
<hi>Brecknock</hi> for my Vouchers, who aſſured me, that from this Hill called
<hi>Mounch-denny</hi> they had oft-times caſt down their Hats, Cloaks and Staves, which yet would never fall to the bottom, but were with the Air and Wind ſtill returned back and blown up again, neither will any thing but a ſtone or hard Mettal fall from thence: and the Clouds are oft ſeen lower than the top of it. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Cadier Arthur,</hi> or <hi>Arthur</hi>'s Chair, a Hill ſo called, on the South ſide of this Country, the top thereof ſomewhat reſembling the form of a Chair, proportionate to the dimenſions which the <hi>Welſh</hi> imagine that great and mighty Perſon to be of. Upon the top thereof riſeth a Spring as deep as a Well, four ſquare, having no ſtreams iſſuing from it, and yet there are plenty of Trouts to be found therein. They alſo told him, that when the <hi>Meer Lynſavathan</hi> two Miles from
<hi>Brecknock</hi> hath its fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Ice firſt broken, it yieldeth a dreadful Noiſe like Thunder. And it is reported that where this <hi>Meer</hi> now ſpreadeth its Waters, there formerly ſtood a fair City which was ſwallowed up by an Earthquake, and it ſeems probable, both becauſe all the Highways of this County lead thither. And likewiſe the Learned
<hi>Camden</hi> judgeth it might be the City <hi>Loventrium,</hi> which <hi>Ptolomy</hi> placeth in theſe parts, and Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> could not diſcover, and therefore likely to be Drowned in this Pool, which the River <hi>Levenny</hi> running hard by farther confirms, the Waters whereof run through this <hi>Meer</hi> without mixing with them, as appears by the colour, and breadth of the Stream which is the ſame through the whole length of the Pool.

<hi>Caermarthen, Pembrokeſhire</hi> and this County about that time, confirmed by divers Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of good Quality and Reputation, the ſubſtance whereof are as followeth. A Man and his Family being all in Bed, he being awake about midnight perceived a Light entring the little Room where he lay, and about a dozen in the ſhapes of Men, and two or three Women with ſmall Children in their Arms following, they ſeemed to Dance, and the Chamber appeared much wider and lighter than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly. They ſeemed to Eat Bread and Cheeſe all about a kind of a Tick upon the Ground, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him ſome, and would ſmile upon him, he heard no voice, but calling once upon God to bleſs him, he heard a Whiſpering Voice in <hi>Welſh</hi> bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him hold his peace. They continued there about four hours, all which time he endeavoured to awake his Wife but could not. Afterward they went into another room and having danced a while departed, he then aroſe, and though the room was very ſmall yet he could neither find the Door, nor the way to Bed again until crying out his Wife and Family awaked. He living within two Miles of Juſtice
<hi>Lewis</hi> he ſent for him, being a poor honeſt Husbandman, and of good report, and made him believe he would put him to his Oath about the truth of this Relation, who was very ready to take it.</p>

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:40348:71"/>This Gentleman adds a ſecond account of the ſtrange and uſual appearance of Lights (called in <hi>Welſh</hi>) <hi>Canhwyllan Cyrth, Corps or Deadmens Candles,</hi> which are ſo ordinary in theſe Counties, that ſcarce any dye, either young or old, but this is ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death, and often obſerved to part from the very bodies of the Perſons all along the way to the place of Burial, and infallibly death will enſue. There is that evidence for theſe Candles, that few or none of any age but have ſeen them, and will depoſe it. A while ſince (ſaith this Gentleman) ſome of my Family ſaw two Candles, one leſs than the other paſſing the Church way under my houſe, my Wife was then big with Child, and it cauſed much apprehenſion both in us and her, but juſt a week after, her ſelf came firſt to me, as ſomething joyed that the danger might be over, with the news that an old Man and a Child of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood were carried that way to be Buried.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>John Davis</hi> a Miniſter in this County con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the ſame Relations with the addition of the following Circumſtances and Inſtances. We call them ſaith he, <hi>Corps Candles,</hi> not that we ſee any thing beſides the light, but yet it reſembles a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Candle-light as much as Eggs do Eggs, only they ſometimes appear and inſtantly diſappear: for if one comes near them, or on the way againſt them, unto him they vaniſh, but preſently appear behind him and hold on their courſe. If it be a little Candle pale and blewiſh, then follows the Corps either of an Abortive or ſome Infant. If a big one, then the Corps of ſome one come to age. If two, three or more, great and little are ſeen together, then ſo many and ſuch Corps will follow together. If two Candles come from divers places and be ſeen to meet, the Corps will do the like. If any of theſe Candles ſeem to turn out of the way or path that leads to the Church, the following
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:40348:71"/>Corps will be found to turn in the ſame place, for the avoiding of ſome dirty lane, plaſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now for the particulars. At <hi>Lanylar</hi> late at night, ſome of the people ſaw one of theſe Candles hovering up and down along the Rivers bank which they continued to view till they were weary, and at laſt left it ſo, and went to Bed. A few weeks after came a proper young Woman from <hi>Montgomeryſhire,</hi> to ſee her Friends who dwelt on the other ſide of that River <hi>Iſtwyth,</hi> and thought to ford the River at that very place where the Light was ſeen, but being diſſuaded by ſome ſtanders by (who proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had ſeen the Light) not to venture on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was high by a ſudden Flood, ſhe walkt up and down the Rivers Bank as the Light had done, waiting for the falling of the Water, which at laſt ſhe went into, but too ſoon for her, for ſhe was therein drowned.</p>
            <p>Of late, (ſaith the ſame Author) my Sexton's Wife, an aged underſtanding Woman, ſaw from her Bed a little blewiſh Candle upon her Table's end, two or three days after comes in a Fellow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring for her Husband, and taking ſomething from under his Cloak, claps it down directly upon the Table's end where ſhe had ſeen the Candle, and what was it but a dead born Child. Another time the ſame Woman ſaw ſuch another Candle upon the other end of that very Table, within few days after a weak Child, by my ſelf newly Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was brought into the Sexton's Houſe, where it preſently died. And when the Sexton's Wife who was then abroad came home, ſhe found the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhrouding of the Child on that other end of the Table where ſhe had ſeen the Candle. On a time my ſelf and a Kinſman coming from our School in <hi>England,</hi> and being three or four hours benight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed e're we could reach home, we met with ſuch a Candle, which coming from an houſe we well
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:40348:72"/>knew held its courſe the highway to the Church, ſhortly after the eldeſt Son in that Houſe deceaſed, and was brought the ſame way. My Self and Wife in an Evening ſaw ſuch a Candle coming to the Church from her Midwife's houſe, and within a Month ſhe her ſelf did follow. Mrs. <hi>Catherine Wyat</hi> an eminent Woman in the Town of <hi>Tenby,</hi> being in an Evening in her Bed-Chamber ſaw two little Lights juſt upon her Belly which ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſtrike off but could not, within a while they vaniſhed of themſelves. Not long after ſhe was delivered of two Still-born Children. A Neighbour's Wife of mine being great with Child, and coming in at her own door met two Candles, a little and a big one, and within a while after fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in labour ſhe and her Child both died. Some years ago one <hi>Jane Wyat</hi> my Wive's Siſter, being Nurſe to Baronet <hi>Rudds</hi> three eldeſt Children, and his Lady being dead, his Houſe-keeper going late into a Chamber where the Maid Servants lay, ſaw five of theſe Lights together: a while after that Chamber being newly plaiſtred, a great Grate of Coal Fire was kindled therein to haſten the drying of it. At night five of the Maid Servants went there to Bed as they were wont, and in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were all found dead and ſuffocated with the ſteem of the new tempered Lime and Coal. This was at <hi>Llangathen</hi> in
<hi>Carmarthenſhire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About the ſame time, I my ſelf, ſaith Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis,</hi> coming home from
<hi>Cardigan,</hi> where I had been enjoined to Preach the Seſſions Sermon, about Evening (though it was as light as noon) and I had nine long miles to ride, there ſeemed twice or thrice from behind me, on my right ſide, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween my ſhoulders and hat to fly a little whitiſh thing about the bigneſs of a Walnut, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared once in ſeventy or eighty paces. At firſt I took no notice of it, thinking it to be only the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:40348:72"/>glimpſing of the little Ruff which I then wore, but by degrees it grew redder, even like fire both for light and colour. At length I turned my Horſe twice to ſee from whence it came, but could ſee nothing, yet as I went on it flaſhed again as before, till I came to a Village called <hi>Laureſlid,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Door where I deſigned to Lodge the fire did flaſh again upon or very near the threſhold of the houſe, and there I think it ſtaid. At that very Seſſions one <hi>John William Lloyd</hi> a Gentleman who dwelt, and whoſe Son now dwells within a mile of <hi>Glaſterigg</hi> fell fick, and coming home was able to ride no farther than this Houſe where I left my Fire to entertain him, and there he lighted, lodged, and died within four days after. Some Candles have been ſeen come to my Church within theſe three weeks, and the Corps not long after. Thus far of Candles.</p>
            <p>Another kind of Apparition we have, which we uſually call <hi>Tanwee,</hi> or <hi>Tanwed,</hi> becauſe it ſeems to be fiery. We judge it to be in the lower Region of the Air, ſtreight and long, and ſhoots directly and level, but far more ſlowly than a falling ſtar, as we call it, for it often paſſeth over three or four miles of ground, or more it may be, for no man ſees the riſe or beginning of it. When it falls to ground it ſparkleth and lightens all about. The Free-holders or Landlords upon whoſe ground it falls, will certainly dye in a ſhort time after, and we ſcarce bury any ſuch here with us, be he but the Owner of an Houſe or Garden, but ſome of the Neighbourhood have ſeen this fire fall upon ſome part of his Houſe or Lands. Two of theſe I have ſeen my ſelf, but the interpoſition of the grounds hindred that I could not obſerve where they fell, but where I gueſt they fell there died in one place an aged Gentleman, and in the other a Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:40348:73"/>To come nearer home (ſaith Mr. <hi>Davis</hi>) my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's firſt Husband walking about his grounds ſaw one of the Darts or Piles aloft, which fell down hard by him, ſhone far, and ſparkled round about his body, he took it for a warning peice, made his Will, and having lived in good health, ſome four or five months after died. A little before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of my own Father aged 96. a Son in Law of his who dwelt two Miles off, but upon higher ground, ſaw ſuch another fall in a Cloſe behind the Old Man's Houſe, which gave ſuch a light, that by it he did clearly ſee the houſe, the Hedges and the Oaks in the Wood adjoining. As to the cauſes of theſe ſtrange Omens, whether they proceed from Good or Evil Angels or Spirits, it muſt be left to the diſquiſitions of the Learned, who it may be after all will be puzled to give a ſatisfactory account thereof.</p>
            <p>In this County alſo, in the Silver and Leaden Mines, nothing is more ordinary than that ſome Subterranean Spirits called Knockers (where a good Vein is) are often heard and ſeen in the ſhape of men little Statured, about half a yard long. And living mens Ghoſts are commonly ſeen in theſe parts, unawares to the Party. We hear that a Man's Daughter fetching Water at a Well, had a blow given her, and a Boy coming towards her ſhe charged him with the blow, who denied he was ſo near, but bid her look upon her Father that ſtood not far off, and with that ſhe could ſee her Father fling a Stone at her, which paſſed with a mighty violence by her Face, and the Stone was found with prints of Fingers in it, but no ſuch thing as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there, neither was he at home the night before.</p>

            <p>The People of this County do much glory in their <hi>Ambroſius Merlin,</hi> who they ſay was born in <hi>Carmarthen,</hi> the Son of a bad Angel or Incubus, the <hi>Britains</hi> great
<hi>Apollo,</hi> whom <hi>Geffery ap Arthur</hi> compares with the Southſaying Seers, yea with the true Prophets themſelves, yet it is thought he was a meer Seducer and Fantaſtical Wizard, and though <hi>Alanus</hi> hath by his Comments endeavoured to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe the dark and hidden Prophecies wherewith his Book is filled, yet the reading thereof was by the Council of
<hi>Trent,</hi> and afterward by Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> deſervedly prohibited as vain, and not worth minding. As to his birth <hi>Humfry Lloyd</hi> a <hi>Welſh</hi> Writer affirms, that his Mother before Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was a Noble Virgin, and that his Father for his great knowledge in the Mathematicks and other abſtruſe Learning, was in thoſe ignorant times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted by the Common People to be a Conjurer, and his Son <hi>Merlin</hi> to be begotten by an Evil Spirit or Male Devil, who in the likeneſs of Men are ſaid to have the Carnal uſe of Women. Many wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things are attributed to <hi>Merlin,</hi> as that by his aſſiſtance <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi> erected that ſtupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Monument near <hi>Salisbury</hi> called
<hi>Stonehenge,</hi> thoſe vaſt Stones being brought by Magick Art from <hi>Africk</hi> into

Some conceived that his Patron's fall was his greateſt guilt and incouraged his Enemies againſt him. In the Reign of Q. <hi>Mary</hi> he was ſent for, and examined about his Faith by <hi>Gardiner</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> who told him that the Queen and Parliament had altered Religion, and therefore required him to imbrace the ſame. To which he anſwered, That he had taken an Oath never to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or agree that the Biſhop of

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:40348:75"/>of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> called him Knave and Forward Fellow, and ſo returned him to Priſon again.

<hi>Carmarthen</hi> to be burnt. A while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Execution there came one to viſit him who much lamented the painfulneſs of his death, to whom Biſhop <hi>Ferrar</hi> anſwered, <hi>If you ſee me once ſtir or move in the pains of my burning, then never give any credit to the truth of the doctrine which I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taught.</hi> And he was as good as his word, ſtanding ſo patiently in the midſt of the Flames that he never moved, holding up the ſtumps of his Arms, till one with a Halbert daſht him on the head, whereby he fell down and quietly reſigned up his Spirit to God.</p>

<hi>Denbigh</hi> to Toll twice with ſhaking of the Earth, yet no farther miſchief happened. This Town is Governed by two Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, two Bayliffs, 25 Burgeſſes, a Recorder, a Town-Clerk, and two Sergeants at Mace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wrexham</hi> in this County is much admired for the Church, which is a fair and ſpacious ſtructure, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtately Tower or Steeple without, and a fine Organ within it, being built according to the moſt exact Rules of Architecture. <hi>Holt</hi> Caſtle in this County was formerly in the poſſeſſion of <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Stanley,</hi> whoſe ready Money and Plate therein,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:40348:78"/>beſides Jewels and Rich Houſholdſtuff, amounted to four thouſand Marks, got by the plunder of <hi>Boſworth</hi> Field where King <hi>Richard</hi> III. was ſlain, but this Lord upon diſcontent afterward conſpiring againſt King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. was beheaded for High Treaſon, and it was all confiſcated to the King's Exchequer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Leoline ap Lleuellin</hi> was born in this Shire, and made Biſhop of St. <hi>Aſaph</hi> by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. At his death he left a great Eſtate, beſides Plate, rich Veſts, and Books to the Canons of that Church and his Chaplains, dying in 1313. <hi>Godfrey Goodman</hi> was born of wealthy Parents in this County, and afterward Biſhop of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> yet was no friend to the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation conſtantly complaining of the firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, amongſt whom he noted Biſhop <hi>Ridley as a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry odd man.</hi> One preſent, <hi>My Lord,</hi> ſays he,
<hi>Ridley was a very odd manindeed, for all the Popiſh Party in</hi> England <hi>could not match him, with his equal in Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Religion.</hi> He died a Roman Catholick and left moſt of his Eſtate to pious uſes. His Uncle <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel Goodman</hi> was Dean of
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> for 40 years, and the Bible was tranſlated into <hi>Welſh</hi> at his coſt. He founded a School and an Almſhouſe for 12 poor People at <hi>Ruthen</hi> with a competent Salary. He pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a fair houſe at <hi>Cheſwick</hi> in <hi>Middleſex</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with his own hands he planted a fair row of <hi>Elmes</hi> for a retiring place to the Maſters and Scholars of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> School. He imployed Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> to make an actual Survey of all <hi>England</hi> at his expence. He died 1601. and was buried in
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Abbey. Sir <hi>Hugh Middleton</hi> was born at <hi>Denbigh</hi> and bred in <hi>London.</hi> This is that worthy Knight who fetcht into <hi>London</hi> the New River Water at his own coſt more than 24 Miles, encountring all the way with an Army of oppoſitions, grapling with Hills, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with Rocks, and fighting with Foreſts, till in defiance of difficulties he had brought his Project to perfection. <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> in the reign
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:40348:79"/>of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by his bounty advanced the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a new Church in <hi>Denbigh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Denbigh.</hi> In 1660. a very great Well in <hi>Chick</hi>-Town was dried up. <hi>Richard Clough</hi> born at <hi>Denbigh,</hi> was a Choriſter at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> whence he removed to
<hi>London,</hi> where he was Apprentice to, and after Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Sir <hi>Tho. Greſham:</hi> Having lived ſome time at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> he travelled to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he was made Knight of the Holy Sepulchre: Some af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that he disburſed ſeveral thouſands of pounds in building the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> and that it was agreed betwixt them, the Survivor ſhould be Heir to the other; on which account, they ſay, Sir <hi>Tho. Greſham</hi> carried away the main of the Eſtate: He gave 100 pound a year to the Free-School in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigh,</hi> beſides his Benefaction to the New Church there.</p>
            <p>This County is divided into twelve Hundreds, had formerly 5 Caſtles, hath 3 Market-Towns,
<hi>Denbigh, Ruthen</hi> and <hi>Wrexham,</hi> and 57 Pariſh-Churches: It gives the Title of Earl to L. <hi>Feilding.</hi>

            <p>FLINTSHIRE hath <hi>Cheſhire</hi> on the Eaſt, the Sea on the North, <hi>Shropſhire</hi> on the South, and <hi>Denbigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> on the Weſt: It is the leaſt Country of
<hi>Wales,</hi> not ſo mountainous as other parts, but lies pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along by the River
<hi>Dee:</hi> The Air is healthful, and the Soil plentiful of Corn and Cattel; the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers abound with Fiſh: There are not many Woods or Trees in this, as well as other parts of <hi>Wales,</hi> the frequent Rebellions of the Inhabitants having occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fioned the Engliſh to make great devaſtations of them to prevent their being the retreats of theſe unquiet people. Fruits are not very common, but of Milk, Butter, Cheeſe and Honey there is plenty: Of the laſt of which they make great quantities of a Drink like Muſcadine, called Metheglin: There were formerly ſeveral ſtrong Caſtles in this Shire, as <hi>Flint, Hawarden</hi> or <hi>Harden, Treer, Rudland, Mold, Yowley</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> the firſt was the moſt famous, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:40348:79"/>founded by K. <hi>Henry</hi> 2. and finiſhed by K. <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt. Afterward K. <hi>Richard</hi> 2. going over to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſuppreſs the Rebels there, his Uncle <hi>Henry</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaster</hi> returning from his Baniſhment into <hi>England</hi> at the ſame time, and being joyned by ſeveral of the Barons, who were much diſpleaſed at <hi>K. Richard</hi>'s Arbitrary and Tyrannical Government, raiſed an Army of 60000 Men againſt him. The King returned in hope to ſuppreſs this Inſurrection, and coming to <hi>Flint-Castle,</hi> the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> were ſent to him from the D. of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to whom <hi>K. Richard</hi> made a Propoſition, That if himſelf and eight more whom he would name, might have an honourable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, with the aſſurance of enjoying peaceably a quiet life, he would reſign his Crown: This the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> aſſured him ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, whereupon the King ſurrendred himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Duke's hands. When <hi>K. Richard</hi> came firſt to this Caſtle, they let looſe one of his Grey-hounds, as was uſual when-ever the King got on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, which Grey-hound uſed to leap upon the King's ſhoulder, and fawn very much upon him, but at this time he leaped upon the Duke of <hi>Lancaster;</hi> and fawned upon him as on his Maſter; the Duke asked the King what the Dog meant or intended;
<q>It is an ill and unhappy Omen to me, ſaid the King, but a fortunate one to you, for he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges you to be King, and that you ſhall Reign in my ſtead:</q> This he ſaid with a preſaging mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſlight occaſion, which yet in ſhort time came to paſs; for <hi>K. Richard</hi> was depoſed, and after murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Pomfret</hi> Caſtle, and the D. of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the Throne by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th.</p>
            <p>This County hath not any River of note within it, but near <hi>Rudland</hi>-Caſtle is a famous Spring, called <hi>Holy Well,</hi> or <hi>St. Winifreds Well,</hi> of which Antiquity gives this Account; That St. <hi>Winifred</hi> a virtuoun
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:40348:80"/>Chriſtian Virgin, having by her exceeding Beauty inflamed the mind of
<hi>Carodocus,</hi> a luſtful Prince of this Countrey, he attempted to allure her to his pleaſure both by large promiſes, and rich gifts, but finding he could by no means prevail upon her Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, at length he reſolved to obtain his deſires by force; and having ſurprized her in a place of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, he raviſhed her weak body, notwithſtanding the utmoſt reſiſtance ſhe could make, and afterward to prevent her complaints and exclamations, he kill'd her, and then cut off her head: And in that very place (ſaith my Author) there ſuddenly aroſe a pleaſant Spring, which continueth to this day, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with ſo ſtrong a Current, that the like is not to be found in Chriſtendom: Over the head of the Spring there is built a Chapel of Free-ſtone, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with curious wrought Pillars, on the Chancel and Glaſs-window whereof is painted the Picture of this Virgin, and the Story of her ſuffering and death. To this Well Romiſh Pilgrims reſort to this day, and others Bathe therein, ſuppoſing that there is much Virtue in the Water. In the bottom of it are many Red Stones, which the ſuperſtitious People believe are ſpots of this Lady's blood, which all the Water in the Spring can never waſh away; and that the green Moſs which grows on the ſides of the Well is her Hair, which though every Stranger al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt carries away a part of, yet they ſay it never waſts; and the truth is, the Moſs ſmells exceeding ſweet, which confirms theſe weak Believers in their fond Opinion.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Beno</hi> the Inſtructor of St. <hi>Winifred</hi> in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, is of ſpecial account is this Countrey, who it ſeems was a Surgeon to a Miracle; for after
<hi>Winifred</hi> was beheaded by the luſtful <hi>Carodocus,</hi> he ſet her head on again, ſhe living 15 years after.</p>
            <p>In the South part of this County divided from the reſt, is a place formerly called
<hi>Bovium,</hi> now <hi>Banchor,</hi>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:40348:80"/>or <hi>Bangor;</hi> firſt a City, and afterward a famous Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery antiently very renowned for the pious Monks that reſided there, they being called by ſome Authors, The College of Divine Philoſophers, and <hi>Bangor</hi> the Mother, or firſt of all the Monaſteries in the World, the Foundation thereof being aſcribed to King <hi>Luctus;</hi> it was ſituated in the fruitful Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley now called, The Engliſh Mailor, upon the Bank of the River
<hi>Dee,</hi> being incompaſſed with a great Wall containing a Mile and a half of ground, two of whoſe Gates, Port <hi>Hogen</hi> to the North, and Port <hi>Clais</hi> South, are yet diſcernable; the River <hi>Dee,</hi> which hath ſince changed its courſe, now running through the midſt betwixt both Gates, which ſtand 500 paces aſunder: This Monaſtery, in memory of the 7 Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> was divided into 7 Claſſes or Wards, every one conſiſting of about 300 Souls, and all maintaining themſelves by the labour of their hands: They are ſaid to have received their Chriſtianity from the Eaſtern Church, diſſenting in their Rites and Doctrines from that in the Weſt, neither would they acknowledg that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had any authority over them in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion or the ſervice of God. They continued 438 years before <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk came to pervert them by introducing
<hi>Roman</hi> Ceremonies, Superſtition and Servitude. Many of theſe Monks aſſembled at
<hi>Caer Legion</hi> now <hi>Weſt-Cheſter</hi> to pray for the good ſucceſs of their Friends the <hi>Britains</hi> againſt the Heathen <hi>Saxons,</hi> and continuing three days in Faſting and Prayer. <hi>Ethilfrid</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> King ſeeing them ſo fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent in their Devotions, askt what kind of People they were, and being told that they prayed againſt him and his Army, <hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>though they carry no weapons, yet they fight againſt us, and with their Prayers and Preaching proſecute us,</hi> and preſently fell upon
<hi>Brockmall</hi> a man at arms that was their Guard, who to ſave his own life left their's to the Sword,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:40348:81"/>and the Souldiers aſſaulting the unarmed Monks mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered 2000 of them, and likewiſe defeated the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the <hi>Britains,</hi> only 50 eſcaping. But God left not their deaths long unrevenged, for this cruel King was ſoon after kill'd in the Field by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian King <hi>Edwyn,</hi> who ſucceeded him in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> Many of theſe Monks were buried in their own Monaſtery, whoſe bodies (ſaith
<hi>Leyland</hi> the Hiſtorian) have been found in the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of man among the rotten Weeds wherein they were ſlain. This famous place hath been long ſince utterly ruinated ſo that ſcarce the remains of a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Monaſtery are now to be diſcerned.</p>
            <p>Another Monaſtery called <hi>Llan Elwy</hi> formerly ſtood in the Vale below <hi>Varis,</hi> a little City built by the <hi>Romans</hi> between this and <hi>Denbigh-ſhire</hi> upon the Banks of <hi>Elwy</hi> and <hi>Cluyd.</hi> The <hi>Engliſh</hi> named it <hi>Aſaph</hi> of the Founder a Perſon of honourable birth, who was educated by <hi>Kentigern</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Glaſco.</hi> This Biſhop in the year 560. flying from the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution in
<hi>Scotland</hi> to this place, erected it into a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's See and built a Monaſtery near it, wherein he placed 663 Monks, whereof 300 that were more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned than the reſt, were imploy'd in Husbandry and other buſineſs about the Convent, the reſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted themſelves to Prayer and Divine Meditation. Among the reſt who attended Divine Service, <hi>Aſaph</hi> was conſpicuous for Piety and Learning, inſomuch that <hi>Kentigern</hi> being recalled to his own Country, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned both his Convent and Cathedral to him. Here he demeaned himſelf with ſo much ſanctity that <hi>Llan Elwy</hi> was after his death called from him St. <hi>Aſaph.</hi> He was an aſſiduous Preacher, having oft this ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That ſuch as are againſt the Preaching of God's Word, envy man's Salvation. He is thought to have died about 569. After which his See was vacant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 500 years until <hi>Jeffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> was placed therein. It is ſtill a Biſhoprick, and contains in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:40348:81"/>it no one whole County, but part of <hi>Denbigh, Flint, Montgomery, Merioneth,</hi> and ſome Towns in <hi>Shrop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> wherein are 121 Pariſhes. It was not at firſt very rich, but made much poorer in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. for whereas the Biſhop had before five Epiſcopal Houſes he hath now but one, the reſt with the Lands belonging to them being aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the Church for ever.</p>
            <p>Another Monaſtery of great account was at <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-wark</hi> in this County near the famous Ditch made by <hi>Offa</hi> K. of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> which begun in this place, running through <hi>North-Wales</hi> nigh the mouth of the River <hi>Dee,</hi> and from thence along the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in the South, and ended near <hi>Briſtow</hi> at the fall of the <hi>Wye.</hi> The Tract whereof is yet to be ſeen, and called to this Day <hi>Clawd Offa,</hi> or <hi>Offa's Ditch. Congellus</hi> or <hi>Comgallus</hi> is challenged by the <hi>Welſh</hi> for their Countryman as being firſt Abbot of <hi>Banchor,</hi> though Archbiſhop <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> makes him the firſt Abbot of <hi>Bangor</hi> in the North of <hi>Ireland.</hi> He was of a pious life, wrote Learned Epiſtles and Died in 600. <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi> the ſeventh Daughter of King
<hi>Edward</hi> I. and Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> was born at <hi>Ruthland</hi> Caſtle where antiently a Parliament was kept. This Princeſs at 14 years of age was Married to <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Holland, Zealand,</hi> &amp;c. and after his death to <hi>Humfrey Bohun</hi> Earl of
<hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> High Conſtable of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> by whom he had a numerous Iſſue ſhe died, 1316. and was buried in the Abbey Church of <hi>Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron Walden</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> Eſquire was born in his antient Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony of <hi>Glendour Wye</hi> in this County, was bred in <hi>London</hi> a Student of the Common Law till he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Courtier and Servant to King <hi>Richard</hi> II. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whoſe death being on the wrong ſide of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he retired into <hi>Wales,</hi> where there aroſe a difference between him and the Lord
<hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Ruthen</hi> about a Common, upon which many ſpur'd on his
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:40348:82"/>poſting ambition, by telling him he was the true Heir of all
<hi>North-Wales,</hi> and he was likewiſe incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged therein by thoſe who pretended to interpret ſome Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the famous
<hi>Merlin</hi> in his favour, perſuading him the time was come wherein he ſhould recover the
<hi>Welſh</hi> Principality. All theſe allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments meeting with an aſpiring mind, and the
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> being at variance among themſelves, He in 1402. and the third year of K.
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. endeavoured to draw the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> to a general defection: aſſuring them they had now a fair opportunity to ſhake off the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Yoke, and to reſume their own antient Laws and Cuſtoms. To whoſe perſuaſions the <hi>Welſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> hearkning, they conſtituted him their Prince and Captain General. Having got ſome Forces to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, he falls firſt upon his old Adverſary <hi>Reynold</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> and takes him Priſoner, yet with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of releaſment, if this Lord would Marry his Daughter; which offer though the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> at firſt not only refuſed but ſcorned, yet was at laſt obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to accept thereof, though his treacherous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law delayed his inlargement till he died.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Welſh</hi> much animated with this firſt ſucceſs break furiouſly into the Borders of <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> plundring and deſtroying all before them, being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed only by the Lord <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> who had formerly withdrawn himſelf to the Caſtle of
<hi>Wigmore.</hi> He having aſſembled what Forces he was able, gave them Battel, and was taken Priſoner, and then fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered &amp; caſt into a deep and filthy Dungeon. It was thought that if
<hi>Glendour</hi> had as well known how to uſe his Victory as to get it, he might at this time have much endangered the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominion over the <hi>Welſh:</hi> But having killed
1000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> he thought he had done enough for that time, and ſo giving over the purſuit retired. The inhumanity of the <hi>Welſh</hi> Women was here memorable, who ſtript the dead Carcaſſes of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and then cut off their Privy
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:40348:82"/>Parts and Noſes, whereof the one they thruſt into their Mouths, the other they preſſed between their Buttocks.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> was compell'd to ſuffer theſe affronts at this time from the
<hi>Welſh,</hi> being ingaged in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous War with <hi>Scotland,</hi> that K. having Invaded
<hi>England</hi> with a great Army, but with very ill ſucceſs, his Forces being firſt defeated by the Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland:</hi> And afterward by <hi>Henry Piercy</hi> his Kinſman called <hi>Hot-ſpur,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> who at a place called <hi>Hamilton</hi> kill'd 10000 <hi>Scots,</hi> and took 500 Priſoners.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Glendour</hi> had ſolicited the <hi>French</hi> King for aid, who ſent him 1200 men of qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but the Winds were ſo contrary that they loſt 12 of their Ships, and the reſt returned home. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> deriding this ill ſucceſs of the
<hi>French,</hi> ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated the <hi>French</hi> K. that preſently after he ſent 12000 more, who landed ſafely and joined with the <hi>Welſh,</hi> but when they heard of the approach of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, whether miſtruſting their own ſtrength, or ſuſpecting the
<hi>Welſhmens</hi> faithfulneſs, they ran to their Ships &amp; diſgracefully went home.</p>
            <p>Although King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. was advanced to the Crown by the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> who Depoſed King <hi>Richard</hi> II. for his miſgovernment, yet many of thoſe who were inſtrumental therein, grew in a ſhort time diſcontented upon one account or another, as is uſual in ſuch caſes, inſomuch that ſeveral Conſpiracies were made againſt him. Among others the <hi>Peircies</hi> Earls of <hi>Northumberland</hi> and <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> with
<hi>Henry Hot-ſpur</hi> began about this time to fall off from him, one reaſon whereof was, becauſe the King at their requeſt, as well as of ſeveral other Noblemen, refuſed to redeem their Kinſman <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> from <hi>Glendour</hi>'s ſlavery, for <hi>Henry</hi> was deaf of that Ear, and could rather have wiſhed both him and his two Siſters in Heaven, for then he ſhould be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:40348:83"/>free from concealed Competitors. And another cauſe was, his denying them the benefit of ſuch Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners as they had taken of the <hi>Scots,</hi> whereupon they went of themſelves, and procured <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s Delivery, and then entred into a League Offenſive and Defenſive with <hi>Glendour,</hi> and by their Proxies in the Houſe of the Arch-Deacon of
<hi>Bangor,</hi> they agreed upon a Tripartite Indenture under their Hands and Seals, to divide the Kingdom into three parts, whereby all <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Trent</hi> South and Eaſtward was to be given to <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March.</hi> All
<hi>Wales</hi> and the Land beyond the <hi>Severn</hi> Weſt were aſſigned to <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> and all the remaining Land from <hi>Trent</hi> to the North to be the Partition of the Lord <hi>Piercy.</hi> Wherein <hi>Glendour</hi> perſuaded them they ſhould accompliſh an old <hi>Welſh</hi> Prophecy againſt the Mole or Mouldwarp of <hi>England.</hi> That K.
<hi>Henry</hi> was this Mouldwarp curſed of God's own Mouth, and they were the Lion, the Dragon, and the Wolf which ſhould divide the Land among them.</p>
            <p>At this time King <hi>Henry,</hi> utterly unacquainted with this Conſpiracy, publiſhed a Proclamation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that the Earl of <hi>March</hi> had voluntarily cauſed himſelf to be taken Priſoner, to the end that the <hi>Welſh</hi> Rebels having him in their cuſtody might have ſome pretence for their Inſurrection, and therefore he had little reaſon to be concerned for his Redemption. Upon this the <hi>Piercy</hi>'s aſſiſted with ſome <hi>Scots,</hi> and drawing to their Party the E. of <hi>Stafford, Rich. Scroop</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and many others, they drew up certain Articles againſt King <hi>Henry,</hi> and ſent them to him in writing, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<q>That he had falſified his Oath given at his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That he came but only to recover his Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, and would not meddle with the King or the Crown, That moſt Traiterouſly he had taken arms againſt his Soveraign Lord, impriſoned him,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:40348:83"/>and then moſt barbarouſly cauſed him to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. That ever ſince the death of K. <hi>Richard</hi> II. he had unjuſtly kept the Crown from his Kinſman <hi>Edmund Mortimer</hi> Earl of <hi>March</hi> to whom of right it belonged. That upon no occaſion he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed divers large Taxes upon the People. That by his Letters he procured Burgeſſes and Knights of Parliament to be choſen. For which Cauſes and many others they defied him, and vowed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and the reſtoring the Earl of <hi>March</hi> to his Right.</q>
            </p>
            <p>K. <hi>Henry</hi> could not but know that much of this was true, yet ſince it did not hinder him from ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get the Crown when he had it not, it could leſs hinder him from ſeeking to keep it now he had it, and if he were able being a private man to get it from a King, he was likely to be more able now to keep it from a private man. And for any objections that Conſcience could make, he had enough to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer them all. For if his Title were good againſt K.
<hi>Richard</hi> II. by his Reſignation, it was good againſt <hi>Mortimer</hi> by his ſwearing Allegiance, Upon theſe grounds he ſatisfied himſelf, and raiſed an Army againſt theſe Lords, whom he prevented from join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Welſh,</hi> and near
<hi>Shrewsbury</hi> ingaged them, where though <hi>Henry Hot-ſpur</hi> ſhewed ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Courage, yet he was ſlain, and the K. obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Victory, taking ſeveral Priſoners of note, and among others the Earl of <hi>Worceſter</hi> whom he cauſed to be Beheaded, and many of the reſt to be Hanged and Quartered, and their Heads to be ſet upon <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> Bridg. There fell 6000 of the Rebels that day, whereof K. <hi>Henry</hi> kill'd 36 with his own hands. And the young P. (afterward <hi>Henry</hi> V.) though wounded in the Face with an Arrow, yet was not wounded in his Courage but continued fighting till the end of the Battel. After this the K. ſent his Son <hi>Henry</hi> P. of <hi>Wales</hi> with his whole Army into that Country,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:40348:84"/>but before his coming <hi>Owen Glendour</hi> was forſaken by all his Company, and lurking about the Woods was there famiſhed to death for want of ſuſtenance. Such was the miſerable end of this aſpiring ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious <hi>Britain.</hi> After this Rebellion was ſuppreſt, K. <hi>Henry</hi> enacted ſeveral rigorous Laws for preventing the like in time to come, as 1. That no <hi>Welſhman</hi> ſhould purchaſe Lands or be choſen into office in any City, Town or Burrough, or wear arms within any City. 2. That if a <hi>Welſhman</hi> ſhould ſue an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> the cauſe ſhould be tryed by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Jury. 3. That all <hi>Engliſh</hi> Burgeſſes who married <hi>Welſhwomen</hi> ſhould forfeit their Liberties. 4. No meeting nor Council to be permitted to the <hi>Welſh</hi> but in the preſence of the Officers of the L. of the Mannor. 5. No Victuals to be carried into <hi>Wales</hi> without Licenſe of K. or Council. 6. No <hi>VVelſhman</hi> ſhould poſſeſs any Caſtle, or Fortified Houſe. 7. No <hi>VVelſhman</hi> to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Office of State, or in any Court of Judicature. 8. No <hi>Engliſhman</hi> marrying a <hi>Welſhwoman</hi> ſhould enjoy any office in <hi>Wales.</hi>

<hi>Jeſtine</hi> of his legal Inheritance. After which he made it his own Court of Juſtice, ordaining his Followers, to whom he diſpoſed of the Lands, to hold them in Vaſſalage of him.

               <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> reports that in the Iſland of <hi>Barrey</hi> in this County there is a chink in a Rock, to which if you lay your Ear, you will hear a noiſe like that of Smiths at work, one while blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bellows, then ſtriking with the Hammer on the Anvile, ſometimes the noiſe of a Grindſtone grinding Tools, afterward the hiſſing of Iron quenched, and the puffing ſound of Flames un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Furnace. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> writes of a place in <hi>Britain,</hi> which is thought to be this, That on the top of an Hill there is a gaping Chink, into which when the VVind is gathered and moved to and fro in the hollows thereof there is heard above a muſical ſound like that of Cymbals.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe near <hi>Newton</hi> on the Bank of the River <hi>Ogmore</hi> near the
<hi>Severn,</hi> there is a VVell the water whereof is ſo low at the flowing of the Sea that you can hardly get a diſhful, but at the Ebb and Fall of the Tyde it riſeth amain, which may be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the wind or air, which not finding a paſſage out ſtops up the paſſages of the ſprings, but when the water is gone and the air has room to vent it ſelf the water boils up abundantly. On the the ſame ſhoat of <hi>Severne</hi> on the top of an Hill called <hi>Minyd Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan</hi> is erected a Monument inſcribed with ſtrange Character and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:40348:85"/>the People thereabout have a tradition, that if any man read the ſame he ſhall dye ſoon after, meaning, I ſuppoſe, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be read.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Lauellin</hi> in <hi>Gouerſland</hi> in this Shire, happened many very ſtrange Paſſages in 1656. as they were ſent in ſeveral Letters to Mr. <hi>R.B.</hi> an eminent Divine lately deceaſed, the ſubſtance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſhall briefly relate. In this place dwelt one <hi>Bowen</hi> a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonel in the late Wars, who by his Valour obtained a good repute, but the War being over, his caſe and preferment led him to a careleſs ſenſual life, and at length he grew ſo vain and notional that he was Caſhiered from his Command, and being then at liberty to ſin without reſtraint, he became an abſolute Atheiſt, denying Heaven and Hell, God and Devil, acknowledging only a Power like that which the antient Heathens called Fate, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temporal Pleaſures all his expected Heaven, ſo that at laſt he became hateful, and hating all civil ſociety, though before he had been famous for Profeſſion of Religion. He ſaid he would give ten thouſand pound to know the Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h about God, and denied the Being of the Spirit of God. In <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1655. he went over to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſome time after his Wife a very religious VVo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man living in his Houſe in <hi>Glamorganſhire</hi> was very much troubled one night with a great noiſe much like the ſound of a VVhirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, and a violent beating of the doors and walls, as if the whole Houſe had been falling down. She being in her Chamber with moſt of her Family, after praying to God, accounting it ſinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulity to yield to fear, and being naturally of a couragious temper, went to bed, when ſuddenly one in the likeneſs of her Husband, and in his very poſture, preſented himſelf, and asked her whether he ſhould come to bed, ſhe ſitting up and praying to God told him, that he was not her Husband and he ſhould not. He urged more earneſtly, <hi>What! not the Husband of thy boſom? What! not the Husband of thy boſom?</hi> She replied, Chriſt was her Husband, at which it vaniſht, without having any power to hurt her. Upon this ſhe with ſome other good People ſpent the reſt of the night in Prayer being very often interrupted by this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition.</p>
            <p>The next night Mr. <hi>Miles</hi> a Pious Miniſter and four other good Chriſtians came to watch and pray with her, in which holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe they continued all night without any diſturbance. But the night following Mrs. <hi>Bowen</hi> with ſeveral other Devout Women being in the Houſe, the noiſe of the Whirlwind began again with more violence than before, and the Apparition walked in the Chamber, attended with an unſufferable ſtench like that of a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified Carcaſe, filling the Room with a thick ſmoak ſmelling like Brimſtone, darkning the light of the Fire and Candle but not quite extinguiſhing it. Sometimes going down the Stairs, and coming up again with a dreadful noiſe. Diſturbing them in their
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:40348:85"/>Prayers, one while with the ſound of words which they could not underſtand, then ſtriking them, ſo that the next Morning their Faces were black with Smoak and their Bodies ſwoln with bruiſes.</p>
            <p>Another Night was very remarkable, and had not the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty defended the Gentlewoman and her two Maids they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably been deſtroyed. As Mrs. <hi>Bowen</hi> was going to bed, by the impreſſion thereon ſhe ſuppoſed that ſome body had lain in it, and opening the bed he ſmelt the ſmell of a Carcaſe ſomewhile dead, however ſhe went to bed, and preſently perceived upon the Teſter which was of cloth ſomething rolling from ſide to ſide, and being forced out of her bed, ſhe had not time to dreſs her ſelf, ſuch lamentable cries and noiſes ſo much amazing her. Yet having ſcarce any cloths on, ſhe with her two Maids got upon their Knees at the bed-ſide to beg God's help and aſſiſtance, but were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly aſſaulted. Oftentimes the Gentlewoman would, by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which felt like a Dog under her Knees, be lifted up a foot or more from the Ground. Some were heard to talk on the other ſide of the bed, which the Maid hearkening to, ſhe had a blow upon the back. Divers aſſaults would be made by fits. It would come with a cold breath of wind, there were horrible ſcreeching howlings and cries heard, and both within and without the Houſe horrid ſuffocating ſmells of Brimſtone and Gun-powder. This continued from nine at night till about three next morning, Mrs.
<hi>Bowen</hi> and her Maids all ſmelt of this filthy Sulphur. At other times Fires have been ſeen upon the Houſe and in the Fields, Mr. <hi>Bowen</hi>'s Voice hath been heard, luring his Hawks, a Game he delighted in, as alſo the Bills of Hawks. His tread, his poſture, ſighing, humming were heard frequently in the Parlour. In the day time often the ſhadow of one walking would appear upon the Wall. I could wiſh (ſaith my Author) that they who queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the exiſtency of Spirits had been but one night at <hi>Lauellin</hi> to receive ſatisfaction to their objections.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſturbances continued ſo violent that Mrs. <hi>Bowen</hi> and her Family left the houſe, leſt they ſhould tempt God by their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bold ſtaying in ſuch danger. She ſent the Atheiſt her Husband the ſad news of this Apparition, who in <hi>May</hi> following coming to <hi>England</hi> expreſſed more love and reſpect to his VVife than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, yet telling her that he could not believe her relation of what ſhe had ſeen, as having not a power to believe any thing but what he himſelf ſaw. But he had not the Courage to go to his Houſe and make Tryal of the certainty thereof. However he continued as Atheiſtical as ever, all his Religion being compriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the acknowledging of a Power which, he ſaith, we may call God, and waiting for ſome miraculous appearance to verifie to him all the reſt which we own as our Religion. Sure if ever a Blaſphemer was unworthy to live (ſaith my Author) this is the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:40348:86"/>man. He afterward returned again to <hi>Ireland,</hi> and ſhut up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſmall Caſtle without any company but one Boy, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he roſe in the night, and talked as if ſome body were diſcourſing with him. Others relate that he was continually haunted with Ghoſts and Apparitions, but what his end was my Author does not mention. However, the former ſurprizing Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have ſufficient confirmation from Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Bedwell,</hi> two worthy Miniſters in that Country, from Mrs. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Sir <hi>Edward Carne</hi> deſcended from a good Family flouriſhing at <hi>Wenny</hi> in this County. He was bred in <hi>Oxford</hi> Dr. of the Civil Law, and Knighted by <hi>Charles</hi> V. Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> He was diſpatcht to <hi>Rome</hi> by K. <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to remonſtrate to the Pope, That if he cited his Maſter to appear at <hi>Rome,</hi> as he had intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was intended, that his Highneſs was not bound by Law to appear, This he effectually performed, pleading that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror was ſo powerful at <hi>Rome</hi> that he could expect no Juſtice there in the matter of the Divorce, Q. <hi>Katherine</hi> being of the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria:</hi> Declaring that if the Pope perſiſted in this arbitrary way, the King muſt appeal from thence to ſome able men in ſome indifferent Univerſities, and if this were refuſed, he proteſted againſt all Proceedings in that Court as null and void. A beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour that diſcovered this Gentleman to have as much courage as ability. Queen <hi>Mary</hi> highly prized him, and no whit the leſs for his Cordial appearing for K. <hi>Henry</hi> in the matter of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers divorce, imputing it to the diſcharge of his Imployment in him who was otherwiſe a through paced Romaniſt, and whom ſhe afterward ſent Ambaſſador to the Pope.</p>
            <p>After her death he ſtill reſided at <hi>Rome,</hi> and by command of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> had audience of <hi>Paul</hi> IV. to acquaint him that his Miſtriſs was advanced to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> To whom the Pope returned anſwer,
<q>That <hi>England</hi> was a Fee of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and that ſhe could not ſucceed as being Illegitimate.</q> This Pope would allow no Prince to be his Equal, but that all ſhould be ſubject under his Foot. Beſides he commanded Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to lay down his Character of Ambaſſador, and under pain of the greater Excommunication, and Confiſcation of his Goods not to go out of the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> but take upon him the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the

So that Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> cannot juſtly be taxed by the Papiſts for a Schiſtmatick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thruſt from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by the Pope himſelf, ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably treating her Ambaſſador before ſhe had made any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in Religion.

<hi>Montgomery</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Cardig an ſhire</hi> on the South, and the
<hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea on the Weſt, whoſe raging Waves, it is thought, have ſwallowed up great quantities of Land in former Ages. The form of the County is like a <hi>Welſh</hi> Harp, though it yields but dull muſick to the Inhabitants, being the rougheſt and moſt barren Shire of all
<hi>Wales</hi> as <hi>Giraldus</hi> the <hi>Welſh</hi> Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian acknowledges, the Air giving little pleaſure, unleſs to thoſe that admire the furious and bluſting Winds that roar from the adjacent Hills and Mountains, which are ſo high, and yet ſo near together that it is reported men may diſcourſe from the tops there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of one to another and yet hardly meet in a day's time, ſo that if the Shepherds ſhould fall out in the morning and challenge one another to fight, before they can come together, the day will be ſpent, and the Heat of their fury abated after they have ſlept till Morning. Theſe Mountains did formerly abound with Wolves which much annoyed the People, to prevent which King <hi>Edgar</hi> Sirnamed the Peaceable impoſed a yearly Tribute of 300 Wolves heads upon <hi>Ludwall</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> where by in three years time they were utterly deſtroyed, and now the Hills are covered with Flocks of Sheep which are the only Riches of this County, for by reaſon of the unevenneſs and rockineſs of the Soil the Plow cannot go, nor the Corn thrive here, though ſome have cauſleſly imputed the ſacarcity of Grain to the ſloth of the People.</p>
            <p>The Inhabitants were formerly the <hi>Ordovices</hi> already mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who by the advantage of theſe Mountains long defended their Liberties againſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> and were never wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued till the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> I.

Into the South part of it runs the River <hi>Dee</hi> with a ſwift ſtream, and glides through the ſame without any mixture of its Waters as the People imagine, becauſe the Salmon uſually taken

            <p>
               <hi>Delgethe</hi> is another Market Town in this Shire, of which I know not whether it be worth relating what is known for a Truth. 1. That the Walls thereof are three Miles high, that is, the Mountains which ſurround it. 2. That men come into it over the Water, but go out of it under the Water: Becauſe they go in over a fair Bridge, but the Water falling from a Rock is cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in a wooden Trough under which Travellers make ſhift to paſs. 3. The Steeple thereof doth grow therein, ſince the Bells if they have more than one, hang in a Yew-Tree. 4. There are more Ale-houſes than Houſes, for Tenements are divided into two or three Tipling Houſes, and Barns without Chimneys are uſed to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harlech</hi> is the laſt Market Town, ſtanding on the Sea-ſhore, cold and barren enough but only of Fowl and Fiſh, having few houſes and meanly built. Here is a little decayed Chapel and out of uſe, wherein Sir <hi>Richard Thimbleby</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Knight lyes buried, who for the delight he took in Fiſhing and Fowling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his dwelling from a far better Soil. Here likewiſe was erected a ſtrong and beautiful Caſtle upon an Hill, with a double Bulwark walled about, commanding the Sea, to impede the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of all Invaders. Near this are two great Inlets into the Sea which People paſs over at low VVater, and upon the Shoar, as upon all the Sea coaſts in this Country abundance of Herrings are caught, and are therefore much frequented at the ſeaſon of the year by People of ſeveral Nations.</p>

               <hi>Monmouth</hi> is a Market Town in this County, and had antient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a very ſtrong Caſtle with many lofty Towers, as the ruins do ſtill demonſtrate.

<hi>Monmouth</hi> is in good repair, and well frequented, governed by a Mayor, two Bayliffs, 19 Common-Council men, a Town-Clerk, and two Sergeants. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Monaſteries were erected and ſuppreſſed in this County, the moſt memorable being at <hi>Caerleon, Chepſtow, God-cliff, Monmouth</hi> and <hi>Llantony,</hi> which laſt ſtood ſo ſolitary among the high Hill that the Sun did ſhine upon it not above two or three hours in a day. As for Manufactures the beſt Caps were formerly made at <hi>Monmouth,</hi> where the Cappers Chapel doth ſtill remain. In Q.

His Book was prohibited by the Pope whilſt the lying Legend of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Saints is permitted to be read without controll. If <hi>Geffery</hi> be guilty of miſtakes they are ſuch as make not for the Pope's advantage, and therefore it ſeems a great miſtake in thoſe who avouch that the Pope made him a Cardinal.

He would not yield to the Pope's Legate, who complained of many Clergymen, keeping their Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings againſt the Canons, intending to make room for the Pope's Favourites, or force ſuch irregular Incumbents to a compoſition. He was of a keen temper, whoſe two edged Spirit did cut on both ſides againſt the King and Pope. Againſt the former he fided with the Barons to whom he promiſed Heaven for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of their Rebellion againſt their Prince, though it coſt him an Excommunication from the Pope, who was the more forward in denouncing that fatal ſentence againſt him, becauſe the Biſhop had told <hi>Ruſland</hi> his Legate, That he would prefer him to be hanged on the Gallows rather than ever conſent to ſuch expila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church as aforeſaid.

St. <hi>David</hi>'s is a Barren old City, having neither Trees to defend it, nor is it pleaſant with Fields or Meadows, but lyes expoſed to Winds and Storms.

<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> he writ a Book of the Wonders of the <hi>Holy Land.</hi> He had no great ſucceſs at Court, and therefore attained to no conſiderable Dignity, till at length he was offered a very mean Biſhoprick in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and his higheſt Preferment was to this of St. <hi>David</hi>'s, of which he gives the true reaſon,
<q>That he was looked upon with a Jealous Eye, becauſe being a <hi>Welſhman</hi> by the Mother, the furer ſide, he was thought to have a natural antipathy againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved no good Subject could come out of <hi>Walee.</hi>
               </q> Being now Biſhop of St. <hi>David's</hi> he went to <hi>Rome,</hi> and there was very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate for an exemption of that Dioceſs from the Authority of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> whereby he highly offended
<hi>Hubert</hi> the Archbiſhop thereof. Whereupon being rather overborn with bribes than overcome in his Cauſe, he returned without effecting it, and dying was buried in his own Cathedral about
1215.</p>
            <p>When King <hi>Henry</hi> II. was at St. <hi>David's</hi> in this County, and from thence in a clear day diſcovered the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> in an huffing bravado he ſaid, I with my Ships am able to make a Bridge thither if it be no farther.

The ſame King <hi>Henry</hi> coming back from <hi>Ireland</hi> arrived at St. <hi>David</hi>'s where being told that there is an old Prophecy of <hi>Merlin</hi>'s, That the Conqueror of <hi>Ireland</hi> returning that way ſhould dye upon a ſtone called <hi>Lechlaver</hi> near the Church-yard.
